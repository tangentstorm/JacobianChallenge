# Aristotle Task Index

This file indexes the Lean statement bank in
`Jacobian/WorkPackets/StatementBank.lean`.

Claude should treat each queue below as a source of small Aristotle jobs. Before
submitting, Claude should copy the relevant declarations into a narrower target
file and ask Aristotle to work only on that file.

The Aristotle account is shared with other projects; job IDs from
`aristotle list` may belong to FourColor or other unrelated work. Record every
JacobianChallenge submission in `aristotle_jobs.jsonl` so future ticks can
identify our jobs without inspecting tarballs.

    `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_neg_form_eq_symm_path` — corollary
    combining `_neg` (form negation) with `_symm` (path reversal):
    integrating `-ω` along `γ` equals integrating `ω` along `γ.symm`
    (with re-indexed cover). Both equal `-cover-with-integral`.

- **Integrated this tick:** none. Refresh-only after the cover-symm
  milestone landed at 14:05.
- **Substantive work remaining (long-tail), in rough order of fit:**
  1. Lift `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm` to the unparameterised
     `pathIntegralViaCover` (Pick) layer. Needs well-definedness of
     `pathIntegralViaCover` first (different `Classical.choose`
     partitions for γ vs γ.symm).
  2. Well-definedness of `pathIntegralViaCover` itself —
     independence from the picked partition. Substantive.
  3. `pullbackFormsFun_smooth` (Queue G) — the ContMDiff step
     for upgrading `pullbackFormsFun` to `HolomorphicOneForm E X`.
  4. Decomposed TorusExample retry around the
     `Bundle.continuousLinearMap` constant-section roadblock.
- These are all multi-tick jobs that benefit from careful planning.
  Next ticks will pick one and outline a strategy.

- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  **🎉 The full `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm` theorem is proved
  and compiles cleanly!**
  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralViaCoverSymm.lean`:
    ```
    theorem pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm
        (ω) (γ) (n) (hn) (pickChart) (hcov) :
      pathIntegralViaCoverWith ω γ.symm n hn (pickChart ∘ Fin.rev)
          (cover_symm_of_cover γ n hn pickChart hcov) =
        - pathIntegralViaCoverWith ω γ n hn pickChart hcov
    ```
  - Proof structure:
    1. `unfold pathIntegralViaCoverWith` to expose the Finset.sum
    2. `← Finset.sum_neg_distrib` to pull negation out
    3. `Fintype.sum_equiv Fin.revPerm` to set up the bijection
    4. `simp only [Fin.revPerm_apply]` to rewrite to Fin.rev
    5. Per-segment `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm_subpath_divFinIcc`
       with `range_subpath_sigma_subset_source` filling in the
       σ-form range hypothesis
    6. `congr 1` to drop the negation
    7. `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_eq_of_heq` (HEq path congruence)
       with σ-to-arith endpoint equalities (e1, e2 via Subtype.ext +
       coe_symm_eq + divFinIcc_val + Fin.val_rev + Nat.cast_sub +
       field_simp + omega for the Nat sub identity)
    8. `rw [e1, e2]` closes the HEq.
  - Build green (8046 jobs, 133s).
- This is the substantive cover-symm theorem that's been the
  focus of the last ~10 ticks. All 8 prerequisite helper lemmas
  combine cleanly.

## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 13:43 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5 (queue empty).
- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathPartitionCoverSigmaForm.lean`:
    `range_subpath_sigma_subset_source` — constructs the range
    hypothesis for the σ-form γ-segment from `hcov`. Mostly
    arithmetic: σ((i+1)/n) ≤ σ(i/n) iff (i+1)/n ≥ i/n (true);
    the σ-form parameter range coincides with γ's segment-(Fin.rev i)
    parameter range. Proof uses `symm_le_symm`, `divFinIcc_le_succ`,
    `Set.uIcc_of_le`, `coe_symm_eq`, `Fin.val_rev`, `Nat.cast_sub`,
    `div_le_iff₀`/`le_div_iff₀`, `mul_le_mul_of_nonneg_right`,
    `div_mul_cancel₀`, and `linarith` to close after multiplying
    through. Hit several iterative debug rounds (Real-vs-unitInterval
    coercion, Nat.cast_sub firing).
  - Build green (`lake build Jacobian.Periods.PathPartitionCoverSigmaForm`
    → 8029 jobs, 128s).
- This unblocks the cover-symm proof: with both `cover_symm_of_cover`
  (handles γ.symm side) and `range_subpath_sigma_subset_source`
  (handles σ-form γ side), all range hypotheses for the
  per-segment sign-flip rewrite are now derivable from `hcov`.

## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 13:27 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5 (queue empty).
- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  - Extended `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralCongr.lean` with
    `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_eq_of_heq` — HEq version of the
    path-congruence lemma, taking `ha : a = a'`, `hb : b = b'`,
    `hγ : HEq γ γ'`. Proof: `subst ha; subst hb; cases hγ; rfl`.
    Useful when path endpoint terms are propositionally equal but
    not definitionally.
  - Build green (2676 jobs, 44s).
- **Cover-symm progress:**
  - Found the right re-indexing API: `Fintype.sum_equiv` with
    `Fin.revPerm : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)` works as the bijection.
  - Proof advances past `Fintype.sum_equiv` and `per-segment _symm`,
    leaving two remaining hurdles:
    1. Need `Fin.revPerm_apply` simp to identify `Fin.revPerm i`
       with `Fin.rev i` after rewrites.
    2. Need an explicit cover proof for the σ-form path (i.e.,
       construct the range hypothesis from `hcov` at index `Fin.rev i`,
       since the σ-form path equals γ's (Fin.rev i)-th segment).
  - Will tackle these in the next tick.

## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 13:20 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5 (queue empty).
- **Integrated this tick:** none. Attempted the full
  `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm` using `Finset.sum_nbij'` with
  Fin.rev as the bijection, but hit a universe-constraint failure
  on the bijection signature. The proof structure is sound (all
  helper lemmas land cleanly when applied per-segment), but the
  Finset re-indexing API needs more careful selection — likely
  `Fintype.sum_equiv` with `Fin.revPerm` or similar — beyond
  what fits in one tick. Failed attempt deleted.

## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 13:17 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5 (queue empty).
- **Integrated this tick:** none. Spent the tick planning the
  full `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm` Finset.sum_bij' re-indexing
  proof. The remaining piece needs:
  1. Unfold both sides; pull `-∑ = ∑ -` via `Finset.sum_neg_distrib`
  2. `Finset.sum_bij'` with `Fin.rev` (involution; rev_rev = id)
  3. Per-term: apply `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm_subpath_divFinIcc`
     (the σ-form helper landed last tick)
  4. Bridge σ-form-path to arith-form-path via `divFinIcc_symm`
     (twice) + `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_eq_of_path_eq` (the
     congruence helper) to handle the Path-type mismatch
  5. Use `Fin.val_rev` to convert `n - 1 - i.val` to `(Fin.rev i).val`
  This is a substantive multi-step proof; deferred to a future
  tick when more time is available. All 5 helper lemmas are
  in place.

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5 (queue empty).
- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralCongr.lean`: path-congruence
    helpers `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_eq_of_path_eq` and the
    provisional analogue `pathIntegralViaChart_eq_of_path_eq`.
    Both proved by `subst hγ; rfl` — relies on proof irrelevance
    in `Prop` to handle the range-hypothesis arguments under path
    equality. Resolves last tick's dependent-type rewrite blocker.
  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralSegmentSymm.lean`: now
    completes the per-segment sign-flip lemma
    `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm_subpath_divFinIcc`. Proof
    pattern: `set σpath`, derive `eq : γ.symm.subpath ... = σpath.symm`
    from `path_symm_subpath_divFinIcc`, transport `h_symm` along
    `eq` to get `h_symm'`, use `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_eq_of_path_eq`
    to rewrite the LHS, and finish with `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm`.
  - Both wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (2762 jobs, 51s).
- All path-side helpers for `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm` are
  now in place. Remaining: the Finset.sum_bij Fin.rev re-indexing
  + putting the full theorem together. (Will need `cover_symm_of_cover`
  + `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm_subpath_divFinIcc` per
  segment + Finset re-index by Fin.rev + `divFinIcc_symm` for
  the σ-to-arithmetic conversion.)

  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralChartApply.lean`:
    `pathIntegralInChart_apply` — definitional unfolding to
    `curveIntegral (chartedForm c ω) γ` (rfl). Mirrors corrected
    layer's `PathIntegralChartCorrectApply`.
  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralViaChartApply.lean`:
    `pathIntegralViaChart_apply` — definitional unfolding to
    `pathIntegralInChart c ω (chartLift c γ h)` (rfl). Mirrors
    corrected layer's `PathIntegralViaChartCorrectApply`.
  - Both wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (2672 jobs, 57s).
- **Abandoned attempt:** the more substantive
  `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm_subpath_divFinIcc` per-segment
  symm lemma. Hit a dependent-type rewrite issue: the range
  hypothesis `h_symm : range (γ.symm.subpath ...) ⊆ c.source` has
  type that depends on the path argument, so rewriting the path
  via `path_symm_subpath_divFinIcc` requires also transporting
  the hypothesis. Lean's `rw` doesn't motive-compute through this
  cleanly; needs explicit `Eq.mpr`/`cast`/`convert` handling,
  beyond what fits in one tick. Marked for later.

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5 (queue empty).
- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  - NEW `Jacobian/Periods/PathPartitionCoverSymm.lean`: substantive
    helper `cover_symm_of_cover` — given an n-segment cover of γ
    by `pickChart`, produces a cover of γ.symm by
    `pickChart ∘ Fin.rev`. The intuition: segment i of γ.symm
    (running through γ(σ t)) lies in chart `pickChart (n-1-i) =
    pickChart (Fin.rev i)`.
  - Proof: refine apply hcov at index `Fin.rev i` and time `σ t`;
    discharge the two boundary inequalities via `Fin.val_rev`,
    `coe_symm_eq`, `Nat.cast_sub i.isLt`, `div_le_iff₀`/`le_div_iff₀`,
    `push_cast`, and linarith. Hit and fixed two initial linarith
    failures by stripping divisions out of `hlo`/`hhi` before the
    refine.
  - Wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (8028 jobs, 123s).
- This is the fifth (and most substantive) helper toward
  `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm`. With this in hand, the full
  cover-symm proof reduces to a Finset.sum re-indexing under
  Fin.rev plus the per-segment sign flip from
  `pathIntegralInChartCorrect_symm` and the segment reflection
  from `path_symm_subpath_divFinIcc`.

    five pointwise apply-form simp lemmas at the bundled provisional
    LinearMap layer:
    `chartedFormLinearMap_{zero,neg,add,sub,smul}_apply`. Each
    delegates through `chartedFormLinearMap_apply_at` (the rfl-
    bridge to the unbundled provisional form) to the apply-form
    bundle in `ChartedFormApplyLinear.lean`.
  - Mirror of corrected layer's
    `ChartedFormPullbackLinearMapApplyLinear`.
  - Wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (2417 jobs, 46s).
- The provisional `chartedForm` API (function-level + bundled
  LinearMap + apply forms + curve-integrability propagation +
  conditional add/sub/refl/symm) is now fully complete and
  parallel to the corrected layer.

  - `Jacobian/Periods/ChartLiftSymm.lean` — new file with
    `chartLift_symm : chartLift c γ.symm h' = (chartLift c γ h).symm`.
    Proof is `unfold chartLift; exact Path.ext rfl` — both sides
    expand to `c ∘ γ ∘ σ`, the σ just gets factored out at
    different points in the bracketing. Promotes the inline
    `Path.ext rfl` from `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect_symm`
    (PathLiftSimp.lean) to a reusable named lemma.
  - Wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (2671 jobs, 51s).
- This is the fourth helper toward `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm`.
  Status of toolkit:
  1. `divFinIcc_symm` ✓ (boundary point reflection)
  2. `path_symm_subpath_eq` ✓ (subpath through symm)
  3. `path_symm_subpath_divFinIcc` ✓ (segment-level reflection)
  4. `chartLift_symm` ✓ (chartLift commutes with symm) — NEW

  - `Jacobian/Periods/PathPartitionSymm.lean` — new file with
    `path_symm_subpath_divFinIcc`:
    ```
    γ.symm.subpath (i/n) ((i+1)/n)
      = (γ.subpath (σ ((i+1)/n)) (σ (i/n))).symm
    ```
    First attempt expanded σ via `divFinIcc_symm` inside the type
    and hit a type mismatch (Path endpoints involve `γ.symm s` vs
    `γ ((n-i)/n)`, which are equal propositionally via
    `divFinIcc_symm` but not definitionally). Fixed by keeping σ
    in the statement so endpoints unify via `γ.symm s = γ (σ s)`
    (which IS rfl). Proof reduces to a 2-line rw chain.
  - Wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (`lake build Jacobian.Periods.PathPartitionSymm` →
    1582 jobs, 31s).
- This is the third helper toward `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm`,

  into one usable segment-level identity.

    Proof: `Path.ext + funext + show + congr + Subtype.ext + ring`,

    `1 - ((1-r)s + rt) = (1-r)(1-s) + r(1-t)`.
  - Wired into `Jacobian/Periods.lean` umbrella; build green
    (`lake build Jacobian.Periods.PathSymmSubpath` → 1580 jobs, 45s).
- This is the second prerequisite helper for the eventual
  `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm` proof, after `divFinIcc_symm`
  (last tick): with both lemmas in hand, the partition-by-partition
  re-indexing for γ.symm reduces to `Fin.rev` re-indexing of the
  Finset sum.

    the partition-point reflection identity. Proof in 4 lines:
    `apply Subtype.ext; show 1 - (i:ℝ)/n = ((n-i:ℕ):ℝ)/n;
    rw [Nat.cast_sub hi, sub_div, div_self _]`. This is a
    prerequisite helper for `pathIntegralViaCoverWith_symm`
    (the partition reflects under `γ.symm`, so segment `i` of
    `γ.symm` lives at `[σ((i+1)/n), σ(i/n)] = [(n-i-1)/n, (n-i)/n]`).

  - `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackFunApplyVec.lean` — tangent-vector
    apply: `(pullbackFormsFun f η x) v = η.toFun (f x) (mfderiv f x v)`,
    a `rfl` chain-rule unfolding.
  - `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackFunSub.lean` — subtraction
    linearity: `pullbackFormsFun_sub` derived from `_add`/`_neg`.
  - Both wired into `Jacobian/TraceDegree.lean` umbrella.
- **Submitted this tick:** none (backlog still blocking).
- No-op-on-Aristotle, locally productive: keep waiting on the 3
  in-flight packets while pushing small Claude-owned lemmas.

## Earlier (now stale; kept for context only)
## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 04:07 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5.
- 🎉 **Integrated this tick:** `f9550953` —
  `Periods/ChartLiftApply.lean`. `rfl` one-liner.
- **Submitted this tick (3 refills):**
  - `f8faacda` — `Periods/ChartLiftBoundary.lean`. Boundary-value
    simps (`chartLift_zero`, `chartLift_one`).
  - `bf7d62c4` — `Periods/PathIntegralViaChartLinear.lean`.
    Provisional from-`X` `_neg` and `_smul` (completes provisional
    linearity except `_add`, same Packet F blocker).
  - `82687eb7` — `TraceDegree/PullbackFunSimpApply.lean`. Pointwise
    `_zero/_neg/_smul` apply lemmas for `pullbackFormsFun`.

## Layer status

- **Complex torus layer: complete (sorry-free).**
- **Queue C foundation in place.**
- **Queue D scaffolding (1 opaque, no sorries):** 11 files +
  umbrella; growing.
- **Queue E foundation:** `AnalyticJacobianGroup E X` + umbrella.
- **Queue F:** Recon document.
- **Queue G:** Recon document (`Jacobian/TraceDegree/Recon.lean`)
  inventories `mfderiv`/`ContMDiff` (PRESENT) vs `pullbackForms`/
  `traceForms`/`analyticDegree` (ABSENT); lays out chain-rule for
  pullback, fiber-sum for trace, 6 packets, flags
  `pushforward_pullback` as the strongest multiplicative anti-hack
  theorem.
- All challenge queues (A through G) have at least a recon document
  or production scaffold; Queue H's theorems live in
  `Jacobian/Challenge.lean` directly.

### Queued for next submission round (gated on current batch)

- `pullbackFormsFun_smooth` — Queue G follow-up to `0b8b1163`:
  prove the chain-rule pullback function is `ContMDiff` when `f` is.
  The substantive piece for upgrading to `HolomorphicOneForm E X`.
- `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect` linearity (zero/neg/add) — gated on
  `ee3ce016` + `fe592ee1`.
- Multi-chart `pathIntegralViaCover` definition combining
  `exists_uniform_chart_partition` (from `PathPartition`) with
  chart-local integrals. Needs Claude-owned design step first
  (subpath / affine reparam), then a clean Aristotle packet for
  the well-definedness lemmas.
- Decomposed TorusExample replacement (split into "constant
  function `_ ↦ id` is `ContMDiff`" as a standalone helper, then
  build the section on top), retrying `259b18a1`'s scope.

## Top open correctness item

`chartedForm c ω e v` should equal
`ω.toFun (c.symm e) (D(c.symm)_e v)`, but the current definition
drops the chart-derivative `D(c.symm)_e` and only evaluates the
section at `c.symm e`. Lean accepts the type only because
`TangentSpace I _ = E` trivially. Consequence: `pathIntegralInChart`
is the right integral only when chart transitions are translations
(torus case); it is wrong on a general Riemann surface. Flagged in
the `ChartedForm.lean` docstring and tracked here as the highest-
priority correctness fix. The proper version uses
`mfderiv 𝓘(ℂ, E) (chartedSpaceSelf ...) c.symm e` (or the
inverse-chart partial derivative API).
- Deferred (per the user's explicit guidance and the
  reviewer-acknowledged staging-phase tradeoff): file granularity
  consolidation, naming-convention alignment, and the
  `FullComplexLattice → Submodule + IsZLattice` design change. These
  belong to the eventual Mathlib-prep cleanup, not this phase.

## Planned packets (queued for Aristotle when queue unblocks)

The chart layer is complete; the next layer is `LieAddGroup` smoothness
of `+` and `-` on `quotient V Λ`. Decomposition into Aristotle-sized
packets below. Each packet targets one new file; allowed writes are
that file only; forbidden files always include `Jacobian/Challenge.lean`.

1. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt`
   of `(q1, q2) ↦ q1 + q2` at a single point. Strategy: at point
   `(q1, q2)` lift to representatives `v1, v2` via `Function.surjInv`,
   use the chart machinery (the same δ from
   `exists_pos_le_norm_of_discreteTopology` works for both factors),
   and observe that on a small ball the chart-coordinate addition is
   exactly the linear sum on `V × V → V`, then mk back. Re-uses
   `localSection_mk_locally_translate`-style reasoning; no new heavy
   API.

2. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmooth.lean`** — promote (1) to
   `ContMDiff (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V).prod (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V)
   (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) ⊤ (fun p => p.1 + p.2)` and from there
   to a `ContMDiffAdd` instance.

3. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt` of
   `q ↦ -q`. Same lift+chart pattern; in chart coordinates negation
   is `x ↦ -x` on `V`, which is `ContDiff ℂ ω`.

4. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmooth.lean`** — promote (3) to
   `ContMDiff` everywhere.

5. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/LieAddGroup.lean`** — combine the
   `ContMDiffAdd` instance from (2) and the `contMDiff_neg` from (4)
   into a `LieAddGroup (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞)
   (quotient V Λ)` instance. One- or two-line `where`-clause once the
   pieces are in place.

When the queue unblocks, submit (1) and (3) in parallel (disjoint
write scopes), then (2) and (4), then (5). All five fit the
"prefer simple tactics" guideline.
