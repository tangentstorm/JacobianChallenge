# Aristotle Task Index

This file indexes the Lean statement bank in
`Jacobian/WorkPackets/StatementBank.lean`.

Claude should treat each queue below as a source of small Aristotle jobs. Before
submitting, Claude should copy the relevant declarations into a narrower target
file and ask Aristotle to work only on that file.

The Aristotle account is shared with other projects; job IDs from
`aristotle list` may belong to FourColor or other unrelated work. Record every
JacobianChallenge submission in `aristotle_jobs.jsonl` so future ticks can
identify our jobs without inspecting tarballs.

## Live Status (2026-04-27 22:09 EDT)

- **Aristotle: 1/5 active.**
  - `b782c387` ContMDiffSection topology recon — verified via
    `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 aristotle result …` workaround: still
    IN_PROGRESS at 17%, **4h58m elapsed**. Off-page in `aristotle list`
    because of pagination, NOT because it completed. Per memory,
    same-% across multiple ticks while IN_PROGRESS is Aristotle
    internal work, not stuck. Workaround for the Windows cp1252
    UnicodeEncodeError in `aristotlelib/progress_utils.py:30` is to
    set `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` before invoking the CLI.
- **Codex:** awaiting user to fire `codex-prompt.md` manually.
- **Local proof work this tick:** verified b782c387 status; heartbeat.


## Layer status

- **Complex torus layer: complete (sorry-free).**
- **Queue C foundation in place.**
- **Queue D scaffolding (1 opaque, no sorries):** 11 files +
  umbrella; growing.
- **Queue E foundation:** `AnalyticJacobianGroup E X` + umbrella.
- **Queue F:** Recon document.
- **Queue G:** Recon document (`Jacobian/TraceDegree/Recon.lean`)
  inventories `mfderiv`/`ContMDiff` (PRESENT) vs `pullbackForms`/
  `traceForms`/`analyticDegree` (ABSENT); lays out chain-rule for
  pullback, fiber-sum for trace, 6 packets, flags
  `pushforward_pullback` as the strongest multiplicative anti-hack
  theorem.
- All challenge queues (A through G) have at least a recon document
  or production scaffold; Queue H's theorems live in
  `Jacobian/Challenge.lean` directly.

### Queued for next submission round (gated on current batch)

- `pullbackFormsFun_smooth` — Queue G follow-up to `0b8b1163`:
  prove the chain-rule pullback function is `ContMDiff` when `f` is.
  The substantive piece for upgrading to `HolomorphicOneForm E X`.
- `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect` linearity (zero/neg/add) — gated on
  `ee3ce016` + `fe592ee1`.
- Multi-chart `pathIntegralViaCover` definition combining
  `exists_uniform_chart_partition` (from `PathPartition`) with
  chart-local integrals. Needs Claude-owned design step first
  (subpath / affine reparam), then a clean Aristotle packet for
  the well-definedness lemmas.
- Decomposed TorusExample replacement (split into "constant
  function `_ ↦ id` is `ContMDiff`" as a standalone helper, then
  build the section on top), retrying `259b18a1`'s scope.

## Top open correctness item

`chartedForm c ω e v` should equal
`ω.toFun (c.symm e) (D(c.symm)_e v)`, but the current definition
drops the chart-derivative `D(c.symm)_e` and only evaluates the
section at `c.symm e`. Lean accepts the type only because
`TangentSpace I _ = E` trivially. Consequence: `pathIntegralInChart`
is the right integral only when chart transitions are translations
(torus case); it is wrong on a general Riemann surface. Flagged in
the `ChartedForm.lean` docstring and tracked here as the highest-
priority correctness fix. The proper version uses
`mfderiv 𝓘(ℂ, E) (chartedSpaceSelf ...) c.symm e` (or the
inverse-chart partial derivative API).
- Deferred (per the user's explicit guidance and the
  reviewer-acknowledged staging-phase tradeoff): file granularity
  consolidation, naming-convention alignment, and the
  `FullComplexLattice → Submodule + IsZLattice` design change. These
  belong to the eventual Mathlib-prep cleanup, not this phase.

## Planned packets (queued for Aristotle when queue unblocks)

The chart layer is complete; the next layer is `LieAddGroup` smoothness
of `+` and `-` on `quotient V Λ`. Decomposition into Aristotle-sized
packets below. Each packet targets one new file; allowed writes are
that file only; forbidden files always include `Jacobian/Challenge.lean`.

1. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt`
   of `(q1, q2) ↦ q1 + q2` at a single point. Strategy: at point
   `(q1, q2)` lift to representatives `v1, v2` via `Function.surjInv`,
   use the chart machinery (the same δ from
   `exists_pos_le_norm_of_discreteTopology` works for both factors),
   and observe that on a small ball the chart-coordinate addition is
   exactly the linear sum on `V × V → V`, then mk back. Re-uses
   `localSection_mk_locally_translate`-style reasoning; no new heavy
   API.

2. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmooth.lean`** — promote (1) to
   `ContMDiff (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V).prod (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V)
   (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) ⊤ (fun p => p.1 + p.2)` and from there
   to a `ContMDiffAdd` instance.

3. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt` of
   `q ↦ -q`. Same lift+chart pattern; in chart coordinates negation
   is `x ↦ -x` on `V`, which is `ContDiff ℂ ω`.

4. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmooth.lean`** — promote (3) to
   `ContMDiff` everywhere.

5. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/LieAddGroup.lean`** — combine the
   `ContMDiffAdd` instance from (2) and the `contMDiff_neg` from (4)
   into a `LieAddGroup (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞)
   (quotient V Λ)` instance. One- or two-line `where`-clause once the
   pieces are in place.

When the queue unblocks, submit (1) and (3) in parallel (disjoint
write scopes), then (2) and (4), then (5). All five fit the
"prefer simple tactics" guideline.
