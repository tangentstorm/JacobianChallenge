# Aristotle Task Index

This file indexes the Lean statement bank in
`Jacobian/WorkPackets/StatementBank.lean`.

Claude should treat each queue below as a source of small Aristotle jobs. Before
submitting, Claude should copy the relevant declarations into a narrower target
file and ask Aristotle to work only on that file.

The Aristotle account is shared with other projects; job IDs from
`aristotle list` may belong to FourColor or other unrelated work. Record every
JacobianChallenge submission in `aristotle_jobs.jsonl` so future ticks can
identify our jobs without inspecting tarballs.

## Live Status (2026-04-26 07:00 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5. All three QUEUED 2h+ — backend stalled
  since ~04:09 EDT, no jobs moving on any project.
- **Integrated this tick:** none.
- **Submitted this tick:** none (backlog still blocking).
- Bookkeeping tick. Waiting on backend recovery.

## Earlier (now stale; kept for context only)
## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 05:17 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5. All three QUEUED ~1 hr — backend
  stalled since ~04:09 EDT, no jobs moving on any project.
- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  - `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackFormsLinearMapSimp.lean`:
    +`pullbackFormsLinearMap_sub` (LinearMap-derived subtraction
    linearity, named simp lemma matching the existing
    `_zero`/`_neg`/`_add` pattern).
- **Submitted this tick:** none (backlog still blocking).
- Continuing local Claude-owned progress while Aristotle queue
  remains frozen.

## Earlier (now stale; kept for context only)
## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 05:16 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5. All three QUEUED ~57 min — backend
  stalled since ~04:09 EDT, no jobs moving on any project.
- **Integrated this tick (local Claude-owned, while Aristotle blocked):**
  - `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackFunApplyVec.lean` — tangent-vector
    apply: `(pullbackFormsFun f η x) v = η.toFun (f x) (mfderiv f x v)`,
    a `rfl` chain-rule unfolding.
  - `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackFunSub.lean` — subtraction
    linearity: `pullbackFormsFun_sub` derived from `_add`/`_neg`.
  - Both wired into `Jacobian/TraceDegree.lean` umbrella.
- **Submitted this tick:** none (backlog still blocking).
- No-op-on-Aristotle, locally productive: keep waiting on the 3
  in-flight packets while pushing small Claude-owned lemmas.

## Earlier (now stale; kept for context only)
## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 04:14 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5. All three QUEUED; backlog resurfaced
  (5 non-ours jobs ahead of us).
- **Integrated this tick:** none.
- **Submitted this tick:** none.
- Brief tick — letting the queue drain.

## Earlier (now stale; kept for context only)
## Stale Live Status (2026-04-26 04:07 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5.
- 🎉 **Integrated this tick:** `f9550953` —
  `Periods/ChartLiftApply.lean`. `rfl` one-liner.
- **Submitted this tick (3 refills):**
  - `f8faacda` — `Periods/ChartLiftBoundary.lean`. Boundary-value
    simps (`chartLift_zero`, `chartLift_one`).
  - `bf7d62c4` — `Periods/PathIntegralViaChartLinear.lean`.
    Provisional from-`X` `_neg` and `_smul` (completes provisional
    linearity except `_add`, same Packet F blocker).
  - `82687eb7` — `TraceDegree/PullbackFunSimpApply.lean`. Pointwise
    `_zero/_neg/_smul` apply lemmas for `pullbackFormsFun`.

## Layer status

- **Complex torus layer: complete (sorry-free).**
- **Queue C foundation in place.**
- **Queue D scaffolding (1 opaque, no sorries):** 11 files +
  umbrella; growing.
- **Queue E foundation:** `AnalyticJacobianGroup E X` + umbrella.
- **Queue F:** Recon document.
- **Queue G:** Recon document (`Jacobian/TraceDegree/Recon.lean`)
  inventories `mfderiv`/`ContMDiff` (PRESENT) vs `pullbackForms`/
  `traceForms`/`analyticDegree` (ABSENT); lays out chain-rule for
  pullback, fiber-sum for trace, 6 packets, flags
  `pushforward_pullback` as the strongest multiplicative anti-hack
  theorem.
- All challenge queues (A through G) have at least a recon document
  or production scaffold; Queue H's theorems live in
  `Jacobian/Challenge.lean` directly.

### Queued for next submission round (gated on current batch)

- `pullbackFormsFun_smooth` — Queue G follow-up to `0b8b1163`:
  prove the chain-rule pullback function is `ContMDiff` when `f` is.
  The substantive piece for upgrading to `HolomorphicOneForm E X`.
- `pathIntegralViaChartCorrect` linearity (zero/neg/add) — gated on
  `ee3ce016` + `fe592ee1`.
- Multi-chart `pathIntegralViaCover` definition combining
  `exists_uniform_chart_partition` (from `PathPartition`) with
  chart-local integrals. Needs Claude-owned design step first
  (subpath / affine reparam), then a clean Aristotle packet for
  the well-definedness lemmas.
- Decomposed TorusExample replacement (split into "constant
  function `_ ↦ id` is `ContMDiff`" as a standalone helper, then
  build the section on top), retrying `259b18a1`'s scope.

## Top open correctness item

`chartedForm c ω e v` should equal
`ω.toFun (c.symm e) (D(c.symm)_e v)`, but the current definition
drops the chart-derivative `D(c.symm)_e` and only evaluates the
section at `c.symm e`. Lean accepts the type only because
`TangentSpace I _ = E` trivially. Consequence: `pathIntegralInChart`
is the right integral only when chart transitions are translations
(torus case); it is wrong on a general Riemann surface. Flagged in
the `ChartedForm.lean` docstring and tracked here as the highest-
priority correctness fix. The proper version uses
`mfderiv 𝓘(ℂ, E) (chartedSpaceSelf ...) c.symm e` (or the
inverse-chart partial derivative API).
- Deferred (per the user's explicit guidance and the
  reviewer-acknowledged staging-phase tradeoff): file granularity
  consolidation, naming-convention alignment, and the
  `FullComplexLattice → Submodule + IsZLattice` design change. These
  belong to the eventual Mathlib-prep cleanup, not this phase.

## Planned packets (queued for Aristotle when queue unblocks)

The chart layer is complete; the next layer is `LieAddGroup` smoothness
of `+` and `-` on `quotient V Λ`. Decomposition into Aristotle-sized
packets below. Each packet targets one new file; allowed writes are
that file only; forbidden files always include `Jacobian/Challenge.lean`.

1. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt`
   of `(q1, q2) ↦ q1 + q2` at a single point. Strategy: at point
   `(q1, q2)` lift to representatives `v1, v2` via `Function.surjInv`,
   use the chart machinery (the same δ from
   `exists_pos_le_norm_of_discreteTopology` works for both factors),
   and observe that on a small ball the chart-coordinate addition is
   exactly the linear sum on `V × V → V`, then mk back. Re-uses
   `localSection_mk_locally_translate`-style reasoning; no new heavy
   API.

2. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmooth.lean`** — promote (1) to
   `ContMDiff (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V).prod (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V)
   (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) ⊤ (fun p => p.1 + p.2)` and from there
   to a `ContMDiffAdd` instance.

3. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt` of
   `q ↦ -q`. Same lift+chart pattern; in chart coordinates negation
   is `x ↦ -x` on `V`, which is `ContDiff ℂ ω`.

4. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmooth.lean`** — promote (3) to
   `ContMDiff` everywhere.

5. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/LieAddGroup.lean`** — combine the
   `ContMDiffAdd` instance from (2) and the `contMDiff_neg` from (4)
   into a `LieAddGroup (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞)
   (quotient V Λ)` instance. One- or two-line `where`-clause once the
   pieces are in place.

When the queue unblocks, submit (1) and (3) in parallel (disjoint
write scopes), then (2) and (4), then (5). All five fit the
"prefer simple tactics" guideline.
