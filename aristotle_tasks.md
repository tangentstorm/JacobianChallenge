# Aristotle Task Index

This file indexes the Lean statement bank in
`Jacobian/WorkPackets/StatementBank.lean`.

Claude should treat each queue below as a source of small Aristotle jobs. Before
submitting, Claude should copy the relevant declarations into a narrower target
file and ask Aristotle to work only on that file.

The Aristotle account is shared with other projects; job IDs from
`aristotle list` may belong to FourColor or other unrelated work. Record every
JacobianChallenge submission in `aristotle_jobs.jsonl` so future ticks can
identify our jobs without inspecting tarballs.

## Live Status (2026-04-25 12:30 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 0/5
- Retrieved earlier this tick: 8d77f7d8 (IsolationAtZero) — COMPLETE.
- Integrated earlier this tick: 8d77f7d8 — clean proof; build green.
- Claude-owned this tick (separate commit): added
  `isDiscrete : DiscreteTopology subgroup` field to
  `FullComplexLattice` per option (a) of the c5beb23a recon. Wired
  into `ZLatticeRecon.fullComplexLatticeOfZLattice` via the existing
  `discreteTopology_toAddSubgroup` bridge — one-line supply. The
  `Periods.periodFullComplexLattice` placeholder gets a new `sorry`
  for `isDiscrete`, consistent with its other `sorry` fields.
  Whole umbrella `lake build Jacobian.ComplexTorus` builds clean
  (8063 jobs, only pre-existing unused-section-variable warnings).
- Submitted this tick: none. Holding at 0/5 deliberately to let the
  refactor settle before submitting the first chart packet (which
  will directly consume `Λ.isDiscrete`).
- Planned next packet: small-ball open embedding for chart
  construction. All three primitives now exist:
  - `IsolationAtZero.exists_pos_le_norm_of_discreteTopology`
  - `MkInjOnSmallBall.mk_injOn_ball_of_isolation`
  - `FullComplexLattice.isDiscrete` (the new field)
  Plus `QuotientAddGroup.isOpenMap_coe` + `.continuous_mk` from
  Mathlib give the open-map and continuity legs.
