# Aristotle Task Index

This file indexes the Lean statement bank in
`Jacobian/WorkPackets/StatementBank.lean`.

Claude should treat each queue below as a source of small Aristotle jobs. Before
submitting, Claude should copy the relevant declarations into a narrower target
file and ask Aristotle to work only on that file.

The Aristotle account is shared with other projects; job IDs from
`aristotle list` may belong to FourColor or other unrelated work. Record every
JacobianChallenge submission in `aristotle_jobs.jsonl` so future ticks can
identify our jobs without inspecting tarballs.

## Live Status (2026-04-25 23:51 EDT)

- Active jobs (ours): 3/5.

- 🎉 **Integrated this tick:** `3265ae48` —
  `Jacobian/Periods/ChartedFormPullback.lean`. Aristotle returned
  the definition exactly as specified; clean, no sorry. Wired into
  the `Jacobian.Periods` umbrella. The corrected pullback now
  exists alongside the provisional `chartedForm`; migration of
  downstream code is the follow-up.
- **Complex torus layer: complete (sorry-free).**
- **Queue C foundation in place.**
- **Queue D scaffolding (1 opaque, no sorries):** 8 files +
  umbrella.
- **Queue E foundation:** `AnalyticJacobianGroup E X` + umbrella.
- **Queue F:** Recon document.
- **This tick — Queue G kickoff:** added
  `Jacobian/TraceDegree/Recon.lean`. Inventories Mathlib's
  `mfderiv`/`ContMDiff` (PRESENT) vs `pullbackForms`/`traceForms`/
  `analyticDegree` (ABSENT). Lays out chain-rule formula for
  pullback, fiber-sum for trace, 6 Aristotle-sized packets,
  flags `pushforward_pullback` as the strongest multiplicative
  anti-hack theorem. Recon convention.
- All challenge queues (A through G) now have at least a recon
  document or production scaffold; Queue H's theorems live in
  `Jacobian/Challenge.lean` directly.
- **This tick:** dropped the `Jacobian.Challenge` import from
  `Jacobian/ComplexTorus/Defs.lean` (it pulled the spec with all
  its sorries despite Defs not using anything from it). Replaced
  with `import Mathlib` directly. Umbrella still builds.

## Top open correctness item

`chartedForm c ω e v` should equal
`ω.toFun (c.symm e) (D(c.symm)_e v)`, but the current definition
drops the chart-derivative `D(c.symm)_e` and only evaluates the
section at `c.symm e`. Lean accepts the type only because
`TangentSpace I _ = E` trivially. Consequence: `pathIntegralInChart`
is the right integral only when chart transitions are translations
(torus case); it is wrong on a general Riemann surface. Flagged in
the `ChartedForm.lean` docstring and tracked here as the highest-
priority correctness fix. The proper version uses
`mfderiv 𝓘(ℂ, E) (chartedSpaceSelf ...) c.symm e` (or the
inverse-chart partial derivative API).
- Deferred (per the user's explicit guidance and the
  reviewer-acknowledged staging-phase tradeoff): file granularity
  consolidation, naming-convention alignment, and the
  `FullComplexLattice → Submodule + IsZLattice` design change. These
  belong to the eventual Mathlib-prep cleanup, not this phase.

## Planned packets (queued for Aristotle when queue unblocks)

The chart layer is complete; the next layer is `LieAddGroup` smoothness
of `+` and `-` on `quotient V Λ`. Decomposition into Aristotle-sized
packets below. Each packet targets one new file; allowed writes are
that file only; forbidden files always include `Jacobian/Challenge.lean`.

1. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt`
   of `(q1, q2) ↦ q1 + q2` at a single point. Strategy: at point
   `(q1, q2)` lift to representatives `v1, v2` via `Function.surjInv`,
   use the chart machinery (the same δ from
   `exists_pos_le_norm_of_discreteTopology` works for both factors),
   and observe that on a small ball the chart-coordinate addition is
   exactly the linear sum on `V × V → V`, then mk back. Re-uses
   `localSection_mk_locally_translate`-style reasoning; no new heavy
   API.

2. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/AddSmooth.lean`** — promote (1) to
   `ContMDiff (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V).prod (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V)
   (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) ⊤ (fun p => p.1 + p.2)` and from there
   to a `ContMDiffAdd` instance.

3. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmoothLocal.lean`** — `ContMDiffAt` of
   `q ↦ -q`. Same lift+chart pattern; in chart coordinates negation
   is `x ↦ -x` on `V`, which is `ContDiff ℂ ω`.

4. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/NegSmooth.lean`** — promote (3) to
   `ContMDiff` everywhere.

5. **`Jacobian/ComplexTorus/LieAddGroup.lean`** — combine the
   `ContMDiffAdd` instance from (2) and the `contMDiff_neg` from (4)
   into a `LieAddGroup (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ V) (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞)
   (quotient V Λ)` instance. One- or two-line `where`-clause once the
   pieces are in place.

When the queue unblocks, submit (1) and (3) in parallel (disjoint
write scopes), then (2) and (4), then (5). All five fit the
"prefer simple tactics" guideline.
