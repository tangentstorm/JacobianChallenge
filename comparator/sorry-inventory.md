# Sorry inventory for `Jacobian/Solution.lean`

**Generated:** 2026-05-05 via static analysis of the full import closure.
**Comparator binary:** not installed; `lake build Jacobian.Solution` was
started but the Mathlib compile had not finished at analysis time.
The list below is produced by grepping every file in the transitive
import graph for actual `sorry` tactic / term usage (not comments).

## Complete list of `sorry` obligations

### `Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/RiemannRoch.lean`
*(imported via GenusZeroClassification → MeromorphicDegree)*

| # | Declaration | Line | Mathematical content |

| 2 | `genusZero_poleDivisor_eq_point_of_nonconstant_mem_L_point` | 71 | Pole divisor of a nonconstant element of L([P]) is exactly [P] |

compact Riemann surfaces.

---

|---|---|---|---|
| 3 | `meromorphicMapToSphere_continuous_of_poleDivisor_point` | 40 | A meromorphic map with pole divisor [P] extends continuously to the Riemann sphere |

| 9 | `holomorphicOneForm_infty_vanishing_of_inversionCoeff` | 476 | If the inversion coefficient is continuous at 0 and vanishes away from 0, the form vanishes at ∞ |

**Mathlib blocker for 5–9:** cotangent-bundle chart trivialization API for
`ContMDiffSection` (`ContMDiffSection.contDiff_localRepr`) absent in v4.28.0.
**Blocker for 10:** uniqueness of complex structure on the topological 2-sphere,

**Mathlib blocker for 12–13:** no Weierstrass convergence theorem for
holomorphic functions (limits of uniform sequences of holomorphic
functions are holomorphic) in Mathlib v4.28.0.

---

### `Jacobian/Periods/PeriodFunctional.lean`

| # | Declaration | Line | Mathematical content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | `h1_free_of_compact_surface` | 90 | H₁(X, ℤ) of a compact Riemann surface is free ℤ-module of rank 2g (requires surface classification and CW structure) |

**Mathlib blockers:** differential forms on manifolds (`Ω^p(X)`, wedge
product, integration), Stokes' theorem on fundamental polygons, Hodge
decomposition, de Rham theorem — all absent in v4.28.0.

---

### `Jacobian/Periods/PullbackNaturality.lean`

| # | Declaration | Line | Mathematical content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | `periodPairing_pullbackFormsBundledLM` | 139 | Naturality: `∫_γ (f*η) = ∫_{f_* γ} η` (Stokes theorem / integration naturality) |
| 22 | `pathIntegralViaCover_pullbackFormsBundledLM` | 239 | Path integral of pulled-back form equals integral of form along pushed-forward path |

**Mathlib blocker:** Stokes' theorem for path integrals / integration
naturality for pullback of differential forms.

---

### `Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AnalyticOfCurveBasis.lean`

| # | Declaration | Line | Mathematical content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 23 | `period_congruence_distinct_implies_genus_zero` | 264 | Abel's theorem (genus-0 direction): if J(Q₁) = J(Q₂) and Q₁ ≠ Q₂ then genus(X) = 0 |

**Mathlib blocker:** no Abel's theorem, no divisor theory, no
Riemann-Hurwitz formula. Uses `pathIntegralFunctionalBundle` (opaque).

---

### `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean`

| # | Declaration | Line | Mathematical content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 24 | `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_id_dualPullback` | 180 | The dual form-pullback along `id` is the identity `AddMonoidHom` (pure linear algebra via concrete `pullbackFormsMap`) |
| 25 | `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_comp_dualPullback` | 269 | The dual form-pullback is contravariant: `(g ∘ f)* = f* ∘ g*` as `AddMonoidHom` |

**Blocker:** the `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle` opaque uses `Classical.choice`
from its `Inhabited` instance (zero pullback); these sorries are the named
proof obligations that the *actual* geometric pullback satisfies
`id`-functoriality and composition-functoriality. Pure linear algebra once the
concrete `pullbackFormsMap` is supplied.

---

## Opaque declarations (not `sorry` but load-bearing named obligations)

These contribute no `sorryAx` to the axiom set; they use `Classical.choice`
via their `Inhabited` witness (zero/trivial value). They are mathematically
hollow until replaced by a concrete construction.

| Declaration | File | Content |
|---|---|---|
| `pathIntegralFunctionalBundle` | `AbelJacobi/AnalyticOfCurveBasis.lean:88` | Multi-chart path integration in basis coordinates + self-spec |
| `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle` | `TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean:110` | Bundled analytic pullback with all specs: `mk_eq`, `contMDiff_pull`, `degree`, `trace_pullback_spec` |

---

## Summary

**Total sorry obligations: 25** across 7 files.

| File | Count |
|---|---|
| `HolomorphicForms/RiemannRoch.lean` | 2 |
| `HolomorphicForms/MeromorphicDegree.lean` | 2 |
| `HolomorphicForms/GenusZeroClassification.lean` | 6 |
| `HolomorphicForms/CompactRiemannSurface.lean` | 3 |
| `Periods/PeriodFunctional.lean` | 7 |

| `TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean` | 2 |
| **Total** | **25** |

### Highest-priority / deepest blockers

The following sorries have no path to discharge without substantial new
Mathlib infrastructure:

- **#15** `analyticGenus_eq_topologicalGenus` (Hodge + de Rham)
- **#16–19** Riemann bilinear / Hodge theory cluster in `PeriodFunctional.lean`
- **#12** `holomorphicOneForm_supNorm_cauchySeq_tendsto` (Weierstrass convergence)
- **#23** `period_congruence_distinct_implies_genus_zero` (Abel's theorem)
- **#21–22** `PullbackNaturality` (Stokes naturality for path integrals)

The following sorries are pure linear algebra / continuity assembly that
should be provable without new Mathlib:

- **#24–25** `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_{id,comp}_dualPullback`
  (once a concrete `pullbackFormsMap` is defined)
- **#11** `holomorphicOneForm_fiberNorm_continuous`
  (chart trivialization argument, ~20 lines)
- **#5–9** `GenusZeroClassification` leaf sorries
  (pending `ContMDiffSection.contDiff_localRepr` or equivalent)
