/-- The type of meromorphic functions on a compact Riemann surface `X`.

A bundled structure carrying:
* `toFun : X → OnePoint ℂ` — the underlying set function (sending poles
  to `∞`).
* `isMeromorphic` — for every point `p ∈ X`, the chart-pulled-back
  ℂ-projection `(fun q => (toFun q).getD 0)` is meromorphic at `p` in
  the manifold sense (i.e. its pullback through the canonical extended
  chart at `p` is `MeromorphicAt` in the usual `ℂ → ℂ` sense — see
  `JacobianChallenge.HolomorphicForms.VanishingOrder.MeromorphicAtX`).

The pullback `(fun q => (toFun q).getD 0)` agrees with `f` on every
chart-neighbourhood of a non-pole, and at a pole takes the sentinel
value `0` at the pole point itself but tends to `∞` in modulus on a
punctured neighbourhood; `meromorphicOrderAt` ignores the value at the
distinguished point, so this still records the right Laurent order
(positive at zeros, negative at poles).

A `CoeFun` lets us continue to write `f x` for the underlying function
application; this preserves the surface API of the previous placeholder
(`MeromorphicFunctionType X := X → OnePoint ℂ`). -/
