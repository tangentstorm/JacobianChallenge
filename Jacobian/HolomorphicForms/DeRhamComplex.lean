# Bridge between de Rham cohomology dimensions and the explicit complex

`Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/DeRhamCohomology.lean` now exposes
`complexDimDeRhamH1ℂ X : ℕ` as the finrank of the explicit quotient:
H¹_dR is closed 1-forms modulo exact 1-forms.

## What this file provides (round 2 refinement)

* `complexDimDeRhamH1ℂ_eq_finrank_cocycle` — definitional bridge from the
  dimension symbol to the explicit quotient model.

## TOPDOWN role

This file keeps the previous bridge name available for downstream
assembly files.
