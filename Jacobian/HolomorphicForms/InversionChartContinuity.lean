# Continuity of cotangent section local representative in the inversion chart

Proves `ContMDiffSection_localRepr_inversionChart_continuousAt_zero`:
the function `w ↦ ω(inversionChart.symm w)(1)` is ContinuousAt at `w = 0`.

## Proof outline

Every holomorphic 1-form on `OnePoint ℂ ≅ ℂℙ¹` is identically zero
(a consequence of Liouville's theorem). The ContinuousAt then follows
trivially because the function is identically zero.

The proof decomposes into:
1. **Identity chart coefficient is entire** (from G2a / chart-trivialisation API)
2. **Identity chart coefficient tends to 0 at infinity** (from the
   inversion-chart trivialization analysis: the trivialized representative
   H(w) is smooth at 0, and `f(w⁻¹) = -w² H(w)(1)` gives `|f(z)| ≤ C/|z|²`)
3. **Liouville** → `f ≡ 0`
4. **Section vanishes at finite points** (from `f ≡ 0`)
5. **Section vanishes at ∞** (from trivialization + dense set argument)
6. **ContinuousAt** (trivial for the zero function)

/-! ### Step 1: Identity chart coefficient is entire

This is the content of the structural axiom G2a. The proof requires
the chart-trivialisation API for `ContMDiffSection` on the cotangent
bundle, which is a Mathlib v4.28.0 gap. We accept this as given. -/

This is equivalent to the structural axiom G2a. -/

  (identityChartCoeff_contDiff ω).differentiable (by simp)

/-! ### Step 2: Identity chart coefficient tends to 0 at infinity

The trivialized inversion-chart representative `H(w)` is smooth at `w = 0`
(from `contMDiffAt_section_iff` at `∞`). The Hom-bundle trivialization
formula gives `f(w⁻¹) = -w² · H(w)(1)` for `w ≠ 0`. Since `H(w)(1)` is
bounded near `0`, we get `|f(z)| ≤ C/|z|²` for large `|z|`. -/

/-! ### Step 5: Section vanishes at ∞ -/

/-
The section is zero at ∞. Uses the trivialization at ∞: the trivialized
representative `H(x)` is continuous, `H(↑z) = 0` for `z ≠ 0` (since
`ω(↑z) = 0`), and the dense subset argument gives `H(∞) = 0 = ω(∞)`.
