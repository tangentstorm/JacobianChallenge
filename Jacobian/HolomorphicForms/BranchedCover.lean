/-! # Production API promoted from blueprint `def:branched-degree` (TRIVIAL/SHORT/MEDIUM/HARD leaves)

Section 2 of `tex/sections/02-holomorphic-forms-and-genus.tex`.

Concrete proof-bearing realisations of the eight sub-leaves catalogued in the
ChatGPT plan `ref/plans/branched-degree.md`:

* leaf 1 — `ramificationIndexStub` (TRIVIAL, proved)
* leaf 2 — `BranchedCoverData` (SHORT, structure)
* leaf 3 — `branchedDegree` (SHORT, proved)
* leaf 4 — `branchedDegree_eq_weightedFiberCard` (SHORT, proved)
* leaf 5 — `branchedDegree_pos` (MEDIUM, proved)
* leaf 6 — `branchedDegree_eq_card_toFinset_of_unramified_fiber`
  (MEDIUM, proved)
* leaf 7 — `branchedDegree_one_fiber_unique` (HARD, proved via
  `branchedDegree_one_fiber_singleton`)
* leaf 8 — `branchedCoverData_of_nonconstant_holomorphic` still lives in
  the blueprint frontier file
  `Jacobian/Blueprint/Sec02/BranchedDegreeFromHolomorphic.lean`, so this
  file remains free of manifold imports.

Imports are narrow (no `import Mathlib`): `Set.Finite` /
`Set.Finite.toFinset`, `Finset.sum` and `Finset.card`, and the
`TopologicalSpace` / `ConnectedSpace` typeclasses needed for the
constancy-on-connected-target story.

Downstream nodes (degree-one bijection, Riemann-Hurwitz, push-pull)
should depend on `branchedDegree_eq_weightedFiberCard` and
`branchedDegree_one_fiber_unique`, **not** on the unfolded
`Classical.arbitrary` choice. The analytic constructor (leaf 8) is
where the open-mapping theorem and isolated-zeros enter the project.

## Compatibility lemmas

* `BranchedCoverData.ramificationIndex_eq_mapAnalyticOrderAt` : links
  the combinatorial index to the chart-local analytic order.

ramification / mapping multiplicity `e_x(f)` of a holomorphic map
between Riemann surfaces. Constant `1` lets the degree-one chain
typecheck before the analytic order-of-vanishing definition lands; the
final replacement reads the local power-series order
`w ∘ f ∘ z⁻¹ (t) = a · tᵉ + O(tᵉ⁺¹)` and lives in the analytic frontier

/-- **Plan leaf 2 (SHORT).** Packaged data for a branched cover
`f : X → Y`: the local ramification indices, finiteness of every fibre,

that lets `branchedDegree` exist before the analytic open-mapping
theorem is in place.

`weightedFiberCard` is provided as a derived definition (not a
structure field), so consumers can rely on the formula
`((finite_fiber y).toFinset).sum ramificationIndex` without worrying
about user overrides. The constancy field is stated directly in terms
of the formula. -/

/-! # Production API promoted from blueprint `thm:degree-one-bijective`

Section 2 of `tex/sections/02-holomorphic-forms-and-genus.tex`.

A degree-one holomorphic map between compact connected Riemann
surfaces is bijective: degree one forces every fibre to have a single
sheet (injectivity), and the same singleton fibre witness gives
surjectivity.

The analytic hypothesis "non-constant holomorphic between compact
connected Riemann surfaces" is absorbed into the existence of a
`BranchedCoverData X Y f`; the analytic constructor producing such
data from the holomorphic input is the still-open
`branchedCoverData_of_nonconstant_holomorphic` (leaf 8 in
the branched-degree story). Once that lands, the
hypothesis here is fed by the constructor and this theorem becomes a
direct consequence of the combinatorial leaf 7. -/


/-- **`thm:degree-one-bijective`.** A degree-one branched cover is
bijective.  Surjectivity comes from the singleton fibre over any
target point; injectivity follows because two distinct preimages of
the same point would each contribute a positive summand to a weighted
fibre sum already equal to one. -/
