# Hodge star and harmonic 1-forms on a Riemann surface

A Riemann surface `X` carries a unique conformal Riemannian metric class;
together with the orientation it gives a **Hodge star** operator
`⋆ : Ω¹(X) → Ω¹(X)` with `⋆² = -1` on 1-forms.  A 1-form `ω` is
**harmonic** when `dω = d⋆ω = 0`.

The classical Hodge theorem on a compact oriented Riemannian manifold
identifies de Rham cohomology with the space of harmonic forms:

H^k_dR(X, ℂ) ≅ Harm^k(X, ℂ).

For a compact Riemann surface in degree 1 the harmonic decomposition
splits Harm¹ as the direct sum of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic
1-forms — this is the *Hodge decomposition* on a Riemann surface.

## Mathlib v4.28.0 status

ABSENT: Riemannian metric tensor on a manifold, Hodge ⋆, Laplacian on
forms, harmonic projection.  The closest existing piece is
`Mathlib.Geometry.Manifold.Metric` for a metric on a single chart;
nothing assembles those into a global Hodge ⋆.

## What this file provides

## TOPDOWN role

This is the **harmonic-projection bridge** between de Rham cohomology
and the holomorphic / anti-holomorphic split. The deep analytic content
(elliptic regularity for `Δ = dd^* + d^*d`, Hodge theorem) lives here.

/--
Bottom-up content: every closed ℂ-valued 1-form has a unique harmonic
representative modulo `d`-exact forms. The argument needs:

1. Existence of a Hermitian metric (compatible with the conformal class)
   on `X` — Riemann surface gives one canonically via local
   `|dz|²` patches glued by partitions of unity.
2. Hodge–de Rham Laplacian `Δ = dd^* + d^*d` is elliptic.
3. Elliptic regularity + `Hodge` theorem (kernel + image
   decomposition) on a compact Riemannian manifold.

Mathlib gaps: 1+2+3 all absent in v4.28.0.  Project gap: even the
existence of a global metric on a Riemann surface (via partition of
unity through charts) is not assembled.
