# Harmonic projection: H¹_dR ≃ Harm¹

The Hodge theorem on a compact oriented Riemannian manifold says that
every de Rham cohomology class has a unique harmonic representative:

H^k_dR(X, ℂ) ≅ Harm^k(X, ℂ)         (orthogonal projection)

Mathlib v4.28.0 lacks the entire elliptic-operator / harmonic-projection
apparatus.  This file decomposes the named obligation
`complexDimDeRhamH1ℂ_eq_analyticHarmonicGenus` (in
`HodgeDecomposition.lean`) into its underlying
elliptic-projection ingredients.

## What this file provides

## TOPDOWN role

Splits the Hodge harmonic projection into:
1. existence of the projection (Δ has closed range and finite kernel),
2. orthogonality of d-image and harmonic (Hodge identity),
3. surjectivity onto H¹_dR.

**Current-model Hodge representatives.** Every harmonic 1-form is
the harmonic projection of a closed 1-form.

This is the closed-form version of `harmonicProjection1_surjective` needed
to descend the projection to de Rham cohomology. Classically a harmonic
form is itself closed, so this follows from the projector acting as the
identity on harmonic forms.

**Period-payload exactness — MINIMAL SUBSTRATE-FRONTIER ROOT.**
For a closed 1-form `ω`, the pure period-payload form `(0, ω.2)` (zero
coefficient, the form's period data) is exact: `(0, ω.2) ∈ ExactForm 0 X`.

This is the *single, projection-free* analytic fact the Hodge decomposition in
degree 1 reduces to: once the harmonic (coefficient) part is split off, the
remainder is exactly the period payload, and the content is that this payload is
realizable as `dθ` for some 0-form `θ`.  It is strictly narrower than
`harmonicProjection1_hodgeDecomposition` — no projection/embedding wrapper, a
bare statement about `ω.2`.

NOTE (substrate frontier): on the current zero-differential `SmoothDiffForm`
surrogate `exteriorDerivative := 0`, so `ExactForm 0 X = ⊥` and this root
collapses to `ω.2 = 0`, which is not yet true for the period-only forms the
surrogate admits.  It becomes the honest classical fact once `exteriorDerivative`
is given real chartwise content (owner of `SmoothDifferentialForm.lean`).  This
is the exact input that file's owner must supply; see `.sci/result.md`. -/

**Hodge decomposition provider (degree 1).**
Every closed 1-form `ω` differs from the embedded harmonic representative of
its own projection by an *exact* form:
`ω - harmonicEmbed X (harmonicProjection1 X ω) ∈ ExactForm 0 X`.

This is the orthogonal-splitting input of the Hodge theorem in degree 1
(`closed = harmonic ⊕ exact`), used by the sorry-free
`harmonicProjection1_kernel_subset_exact` assembly below.

**Now sorry-free**: the subtracted form is the embedded harmonic projection
`(ω.1, 0)`, so the remainder is the pure period payload `(0, ω.2)`, whose
exactness is supplied by the minimal root `hodgeRemainder_periodPayload_exact`. -/

**Current-model Hodge representative uniqueness.** If a closed
1-form has zero harmonic projection, then it is exact.

Bottom-up content: Hodge decomposition writes every closed form as a
harmonic form plus an exact form; the zero-projection condition kills the
harmonic summand.

This **assembly is sorry-free**: it consumes the narrowest provider
`harmonicProjection1_hodgeDecomposition`.  When the harmonic projection
vanishes, the embedded harmonic representative is `harmonicEmbed X 0 = 0`, so
`ω - 0 = ω` is exactly the exact form supplied by the decomposition.
