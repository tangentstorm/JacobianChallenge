# Hodge decomposition dimension formula on a Riemann surface (frontier)

Assembled frontier identity: for a compact connected Riemann surface
`X` of analytic genus `g`,

  dim_ℂ H¹_dR(X, ℂ) = 2 g.

The classical proof routes through the *harmonic decomposition*:

  H¹_dR(X, ℂ) ≅ Harm¹(X)
              = Ω¹(X)_holo ⊕ Ω¹(X)_anti
              ≅ ℂ^g ⊕ ℂ^g.

The conjugation isomorphism on `Ω¹(X)_anti ≃ Ω¹(X)_holo` (as ℝ-vector
spaces) gives `dim_ℂ Ω¹_anti = g`, so the total dim is `2g`.

## Mathlib v4.28.0 status

Each ingredient is a frontier sorry:

* harmonic projection (`HodgeStarRS.lean`),
* anti-holomorphic conjugation (`AntiHolomorphicOneForm.lean`),
* `\bar Ω¹` finite-dim (`AntiHolomorphicOneForm.lean`).

This file performs the **arithmetic assembly** and is sorry-free
relative to its named obligations.

## What this file provides

* `complexDim_deRhamH1ℂ_eq_two_analyticGenus` — frontier theorem,
  *sorry-free assembly* of the named harmonic-projection and
  conjugation obligations.

* `complexDim_deRhamH1ℂ_eq_two_analyticGenus_via_harmonic` — the same
  identity stated as the explicit `2 * analyticGenus ℂ X` (RHS form
  consumed by the top-level `hodge_deRham_rank_eq` assembly).

## TOPDOWN role

This is the **Hodge side** of the dimension chain:
`2g = dim_ℂ Ω¹ + dim_ℂ \bar Ω¹ = dim_ℂ Harm¹ = dim_ℂ H¹_dR`.

/-- **Frontier theorem (sorry).** Bridge between the harmonic space and
the de Rham H¹: `dim_ℂ H¹_dR(X, ℂ) = analyticHarmonicGenus X`.

This is the named numeric form of the Hodge harmonic-projection
isomorphism (`complexDim_deRhamH1_eq_analyticHarmonicGenus` in
`HodgeStarRS.lean` is currently an `rfl` placeholder; the *real* bridge
lives here). -/
