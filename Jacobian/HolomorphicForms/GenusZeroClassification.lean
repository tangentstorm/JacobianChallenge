# Genus-zero classification

A compact connected Riemann surface has analytic genus zero iff it is
homeomorphic to the standard 2-sphere `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1`.

Top-down obligation: pointed to by `Jacobian/Solution.lean` for the
`genus_eq_zero_iff_homeo` lemma.

#### 3-step Mathlib-API plan for a future job

**Step 1 — Define `ℂℙ¹` as a complex manifold.**
Define `ℂℙ¹` (e.g. as `Projectivization ℂ (Fin 2 → ℂ)` or as the
one-point compactification `AlexandrovCompactification ℂ`). Equip it
with `ChartedSpace ℂ` and `IsManifold` instances using the standard
two-chart atlas (`z ↦ z`, `z ↦ 1/z`). Prove it is compact, connected,
T2, and homeomorphic to `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1`.

**Step 2 — Compute `H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0` directly.**
Bypass the general Riemann–Roch machinery: show that any holomorphic
1-form on `ℂℙ¹` restricts to `f(z) dz` on the standard chart `U₀ ≅ ℂ`,
and the transition to the chart `U₁` forces `f(z) = 0` (by Liouville's
theorem applied to the resulting entire function with growth constraint).
Conclude `Subsingleton (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ ℂℙ¹)`.

**Step 3 — Transport along homeomorphism.**
For compact Riemann surfaces `X ≃ₜ ℂℙ¹`, the homeomorphism lifts to a
biholomorphism (by uniqueness of complex structure on `S²`), giving an
isomorphism of 1-form spaces. Transport the subsingleton result from
Step 2 to `X` and apply `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_subsingleton`.

An alternative shortcut for **Step 3** (avoiding uniformization): if
we only need genus 0, prove directly that `Module.finrank` of sections
of a bundle is invariant under biholomorphism, and show the
homeomorphism `X ≃ₜ S²` lifts to a biholomorphism `X ≃ₕ ℂℙ¹` using
the fact that every orientation-preserving homeomorphism between
Riemann surfaces is homotopic to a biholomorphism (Earle–Eells).

### Refined decomposition of the easy direction

The easy direction `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere` is now
assembled from three smaller named obligations, each Aristotle-shaped:

* `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton` — the space of holomorphic
  1-forms on `ℂℙ¹ = OnePoint ℂ` is a subsingleton (i.e. only the zero
  form exists).  This is the substantive analytic content
  (Liouville-style argument on the inversion chart).
* `analyticGenus_onePointCx_eq_zero` — pure corollary of the subsingleton
  fact via `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_subsingleton`.
* `analyticGenus_eq_of_homeomorphic_sphere_of_onePointCx` — the
  uniformization-lite transport step: a compact Riemann surface
  homeomorphic to `S²` has the same analytic genus as `OnePoint ℂ`.
  This bundles the deep "every complex structure on `S²` is biholomorphic
  to `ℂℙ¹`" content into a single named obligation.

The original `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere` becomes pure
assembly of these three pieces. The hard direction
`homeomorphic_sphere_of_analyticGenus_eq_zero` below is unchanged.
-/

/-!
#### Proof plan for `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton`

A holomorphic 1-form on `OnePoint ℂ` pulled back to
the identity chart is `f(z) dz` for some entire function `f : ℂ → ℂ`;
under the inversion-chart transition `w = z⁻¹`, it becomes
`-f(1/w) / w² dw`. Holomorphicity at `w = 0` forces `f(1/w) / w²` to be
bounded near zero, which by Liouville's theorem forces `f ≡ 0`.
-/

/--
An entire function `f : ℂ → ℂ` that tends to `0` along `cocompact ℂ`
(i.e. as `|z| → ∞`) is identically zero.

#### Refined chart-extraction split

Splitting them lets two separate Aristotle/sub-agent jobs target each
leaf with disjoint reasoning patterns.

### TOPDOWN decomposition for `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`
(integrated from Aristotle 76c01cf9)

* `holomorphicOneForm_coeff_entire` — the coefficient function
  `holomorphicOneForm_coeff ω` is entire (carries the chart-extraction gap).
* `holomorphicOneForm_coeff_tendsto_zero` — the coefficient function tends
  to `0` along `cocompact ℂ` (carries the chart-extraction + chart-transition
  formula gap).

Assembly: apply `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_tendsto_zero_cocompact` (Liouville)
to `holomorphicOneForm_coeff ω`, then `ω.toFun (↑z) = 0` follows because
`ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` is determined by its value at `1` (via `ext`).

Vanishing of a holomorphic 1-form at the point at infinity of
`OnePoint ℂ`.

**Substantive content (continuity of inversion-chart coefficient).**
On the inversion chart (source `(OnePoint ℂ) \ {↑0}`, forward map
`↑z ↦ z⁻¹`, `∞ ↦ 0`), the section `ω` reads as `g(w) dw` for some
`g : ℂ → ℂ`, where `g(w) = (ω.toFun ((·⁻¹) w)) 1` for `w ≠ 0` and
`g(0) = (ω.toFun ∞) 1`.

By `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`, for `w ≠ 0`
the value `ω.toFun ↑(w⁻¹) = 0`, so `g(w) = 0` on `{w | w ≠ 0}`.
Continuity of the bundle-trivialised section at `w = 0` then forces
`g(0) = 0`, i.e. `(ω.toFun ∞) 1 = 0`. Since the cotangent fiber over
`∞` is `ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` (also determined by its value at `1`), we conclude
`ω.toFun ∞ = 0`.

**Note:** this lemma takes `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`
as a *hypothesis* through the calling order (the assembly theorem
provides it via `cases x using OnePoint.rec`). The two leaves carry
disjoint analytic content.

**Infinity vanishing of holomorphic 1-forms on `OnePoint ℂ`.**

Direct proof (integrated from Aristotle 50ed9388, salvaged via the
bundle-trivialization + density argument): use the local trivialization
of the cotangent bundle around `OnePoint.infty` to translate
the bundle-section vanishing into a continuous function `phi` on the
trivialization base set; show `phi` vanishes at every finite point
(via the existing `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`);
conclude by density of `OnePoint.some : ℂ → OnePoint ℂ`.

This bypasses the inversion-chart route — `holomorphicOneFormOnePointCxInfinityVanishingData`
and the inversion-chart leaves it depends on are no longer load-bearing for
this theorem (they remain useful for `holomorphicOneForm_coeff_tendsto_zero`).

### TOPDOWN decomposition of `holomorphicOneFormLinearEquivOfHomeoSphere`
(integrated from Aristotle 88effa1c)

Reduced to a single sub-obligation
`subsingleton_holomorphicOneForm_of_homeo_sphere`. The linear
equivalence is then constructed via `LinearEquiv.ofSubsingleton`,
using the existing `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton` for
the codomain.

Mathlib gaps for the sub-obligation: uniformization at genus 0,
pullback of holomorphic 1-forms along biholomorphisms, simply-connected
instance for `Metric.sphere` / `OnePoint ℂ`. All absent in v4.28.0.

Riemann surface homeomorphic to S² has a subsingleton space of

uniqueness of complex structure on S² (uniformization at genus 0)
implies X is biholomorphic to `OnePoint ℂ ≃ ℂℙ¹`, which has
`H⁰(Ω¹) = 0`.

Complex-structure uniqueness assembly for the Riemann sphere: the degree-one
meromorphic route data induces the smooth homeomorphism required by the
two-chart global-gluing selector.

This is the remaining genuine analytic genus-zero input.  It is narrower than
the patch-selector/gluing data: once this smooth uniformization is available,
the selector below is the explicit two-chart packaging.

**Structural axiom (G1a, uniformization at genus 0).** A compact
connected Riemann surface homeomorphic to `OnePoint ℂ` (= ℂℙ¹) admits a
*biholomorphism* to `OnePoint ℂ` — i.e. there EXISTS a homeomorphism
that is `ContMDiff` in both directions.

Note: the *given* homeomorphism `_e` need not itself be smooth (e.g.
complex conjugation on `OnePoint ℂ` is a self-homeomorphism that is
not `ℂ`-smooth); we must therefore construct a different homeomorphism
`f` that is smooth in both directions. This is the classical content of
the uniformization theorem at genus 0: every compact simply-connected
Riemann surface is biholomorphic to `ℂℙ¹`.

Transport step: a compact Riemann surface `X` homeomorphic to the
standard 2-sphere has the same analytic genus as `OnePoint ℂ`.

This is the "uniformization-lite" content: a topological homeomorphism
from `X` to `S²`, combined with the existing complex structure on `X`
and the canonical complex structure on `OnePoint ℂ` (from
`OnePointCxIsManifold`), forces a biholomorphism `X ≃ OnePoint ℂ` (since
every complex structure on the topological 2-sphere is biholomorphic to
`ℂℙ¹` — uniformization at genus 0). The biholomorphism induces a
ℂ-linear isomorphism of holomorphic 1-form spaces, hence equality of
analytic genera.

Stated as an equality of natural numbers, since both sides are defined
once their `FiniteDimensionalHolomorphicOneForms` instances are
available (`X`'s comes from the hypothesis, `OnePoint ℂ`'s comes from
`finiteDimensionalHolomorphicOneForms_onePointCx` above).

#### Mathematical content

A compact connected Riemann surface `X` with `analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`
(i.e. `H⁰(X, Ω¹) = 0`, equivalently
`Subsingleton (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X)` by
`analyticGenus_eq_zero_iff_subsingleton`) is homeomorphic to `S²`.

The standard proof runs through the following chain:

1. **Genus 0 ⟹ simply connected.** By the topological classification
   of compact oriented surfaces, the topological genus equals the
   analytic genus (Hodge theory / de Rham). A compact oriented surface
   of topological genus 0 is simply connected.

2. **Simply connected compact Riemann surface ⟹ biholomorphic to ℂℙ¹.**
   The uniformization theorem says every simply connected Riemann surface
   is biholomorphic to ℂ, 𝔻, or ℂℙ¹. Compactness rules out ℂ and 𝔻.

3. **ℂℙ¹ ≃ₜ S².** The one-point compactification of ℂ (= ℂℙ¹ as a
   topological space) is homeomorphic to the standard 2-sphere in ℝ³
   via stereographic projection.

An alternative route avoids uniformization entirely by using Riemann–Roch
+ a rational function argument:

1'. **Genus 0 + Riemann–Roch ⟹ ∃ meromorphic function of degree 1.**
    With `g = 0`, Riemann–Roch gives `ℓ(D) - ℓ(K-D) ≥ deg D + 1` for
    any divisor `D`. Taking `D` = a single point gives a meromorphic
    function with a single simple pole, i.e. of degree 1.

2'. **Degree-1 meromorphic function ⟹ biholomorphism to ℂℙ¹.**
    A meromorphic function of degree 1 on a compact Riemann surface is a
    biholomorphism onto ℂℙ¹.

3'. Same as step 3.

#### 3-step Mathlib-API plan for a future job

**Step 1 — Build `ℂℙ¹` as a complex manifold and prove `ℂℙ¹ ≃ₜ S²`.**

Define `ℂℙ¹` as `OnePoint ℂ` (the Alexandrov one-point compactification
of `ℂ`). Equip it with:
- A `T2Space` instance (requires locally compact + T2 of `ℂ`, which
  Mathlib already has).
- A `ChartedSpace ℂ` instance via two charts: `z ↦ z` on `ℂ ⊂ OnePoint ℂ`
  and `z ↦ 1/z` on `(OnePoint ℂ) \ {0}`.
- An `IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) ⊤` instance by showing chart
  transitions are holomorphic (they are `z ↦ 1/z` on `ℂ \ {0}`).
- A `Homeomorph` from `OnePoint ℂ` to `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1`
  by composing the identification `ℂ ≅ ℝ²` with the inverse of
  stereographic projection and extending continuously to the point at
  infinity.

**Estimated difficulty:** Medium-hard. The topological parts (compact,
connected, T2) are close to what Mathlib has for `OnePoint`. The main
work is constructing the complex atlas and proving the homeomorphism
with `S²`. The latter requires showing that `stereographic'⁻¹ ∘ (ℂ → ℝ²)`
extends continuously to a bijection `OnePoint ℂ → S²`. Roughly 300–600
lines of new Lean code.

**Step 2 — Prove `H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0` directly (no Riemann–Roch).**

Show `Subsingleton (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ (OnePoint ℂ))` by a direct
argument: a holomorphic 1-form on `OnePoint ℂ` restricts to `f(z) dz`
on the standard chart `ℂ`, where `f : ℂ → ℂ` is entire. On the chart at
infinity, the transition gives `f(z) dz = -f(1/w) / w² dw`, which must
be holomorphic at `w = 0`. By Liouville's theorem (available in Mathlib:
`Complex.liouville_theorem`), `f` is constant, and the holomorphicity
condition at infinity forces the constant to be zero.

**Estimated difficulty:** Medium. Liouville's theorem is available.
The main challenge is formalizing what "holomorphic 1-form on a charted
space" means in terms of the chart transition — this depends on the
project's `HolomorphicOneForm` API and may require additional interface
lemmas.

**Step 3 — The actual uniformization step (genus 0 ⟹ biholomorphic to ℂℙ¹).**

This is the hardest step and has two possible sub-approaches:

**(3a) Via uniformization theorem (very hard).** Prove the uniformization
theorem for compact Riemann surfaces: every simply connected Riemann
surface is biholomorphic to ℂ, 𝔻, or ℂℙ¹. This is a major theorem
requiring Perron's method, Dirichlet problem on Riemann surfaces,
normal families, and the Riemann mapping theorem. Estimated at 2000+
lines of new Lean code. Then show `genus 0 ⟹ simply connected`
(requires Hodge theory or classification of surfaces).

**(3b) Via Riemann–Roch (hard).** Prove the Riemann–Roch theorem for
compact Riemann surfaces. Then the argument is: genus 0 ⟹ degree-1
meromorphic function exists ⟹ biholomorphism to ℂℙ¹. This avoids
uniformization but requires sheaf cohomology, Serre duality, and
divisor theory. Estimated at 1500+ lines.

**(3c) Via direct Mittag-Leffler–style argument (moderately hard).**
Avoid both uniformization and full Riemann–Roch. Use the vanishing
of `H¹(X, 𝒪)` (which follows from `H⁰(X, Ω¹) = 0` by Serre duality —
but Serre duality itself is nontrivial). Then Mittag-Leffler–type
arguments produce a meromorphic function of degree 1. This still
requires substantial analytic machinery not in Mathlib.

#### Honest assessment

This theorem is **not realistically formalizable** with the current
Mathlib API (v4.28.0). The gap is enormous:

- **ℂℙ¹ as a complex manifold** does not exist. Building it (Step 1)
is a self-contained project of moderate size (~500 lines) and is the
only step that could plausibly be completed in a focused effort.

- **The uniformization theorem** (or any equivalent, such as
Riemann–Roch for Riemann surfaces) is entirely absent and represents
one of the deepest results in complex analysis / algebraic geometry.
No path through Mathlib's current API gets close.

- **The bridge from analytic genus to topological genus** (Hodge theory /
de Rham cohomology) is also absent. Without it, even the implication
"genus 0 ⟹ simply connected" cannot be stated.

- **Comparison with the easy direction:** the easy direction
(`analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere`) requires showing
`H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0`, which can be done with Steps 1–2 alone (no
uniformization). The hard direction additionally requires Step 3,
which is strictly more demanding.

#### Nearest Mathlib footholds (for future work)

- `OnePoint` (one-point compactification): good starting point for
  defining `ℂℙ¹` topologically.
- `stereographic` / `stereographic'` / `EuclideanSpace.instChartedSpaceSphere`:
  real manifold structure on `S²`, needed for Step 1's homeomorphism.
- `Complex.liouville_theorem`: Liouville's theorem for bounded entire
  functions, needed for Step 2.
- `MeromorphicAt`: pointwise meromorphic function API, useful building
  block for Steps 2–3.
- `SimplyConnectedSpace`: the class exists, though no instance for `S²`.
- `IsCoveringMap` + path lifting: covering space theory, relevant if
  pursuing uniformization via universal covers.

### TOPDOWN decomposition for `genus_zero_homeomorph_onePointCx`

1. `genus_zero_exists_simplePole_meromorphicMap` — from
   `analyticGenus = 0`, Riemann-Roch produces a meromorphic function with one
   simple pole.
2. `simplePole_meromorphicMap_proper_degreeOne` — compactness/properness and
   divisor-degree bookkeeping promote that function to a proper degree-one map
   to `OnePoint ℂ`.
3. `proper_degreeOne_meromorphicMap_biholomorphic` — a proper degree-one
   holomorphic map is a biholomorphic parametrization, hence a homeomorphism.

This is the exact remaining Riemann-Roch-to-route-data obligation for
the genus-zero classification: for a compact connected Riemann surface
of analytic genus zero, there exists a `GenusZeroSimplePoleMeromorphicMap`
whose underlying `MeromorphicMapToSphere` carries both honest
`PoleModulusData` and honest `BranchedCoverDataOfPoleDegree`.

**Status.** The bundled-record style makes the missing analytical
content precise: it lives in this single subtype-inhabitation
obligation. The remaining mathematical work is to replace the
scaffold-backed `singlePoleMeromorphicMap` route in
`riemannRochSpace_dim_ge_two_implies_nonconstant_meromorphic` /
`genusZero_pointRiemannRochSpace_witness_exists` with an honest
meromorphic function produced by Riemann-Roch.

**What is already in place.** Weighted-fiber conservation for ContMDiff
maps between compact preconnected complex 1-manifolds is now proved
(`weightedFiberConservation_of_contMDiff` in
`Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/HolomorphicMap.lean`). So once the meromorphic
function is produced honestly, building `BranchedCoverDataOfPoleDegree`
reduces to matching the branched degree with the pole-divisor degree
(`Divisor.point P`'s degree is `1`). That remaining matching step is
the only purely-analytic part still open.
