# Genus-zero classification

A compact connected Riemann surface has analytic genus zero iff it is
homeomorphic to the standard 2-sphere `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1`.

Proof deferred — this is the genus-zero classification (uniformization
theorem / Riemann–Roch + classification of compact connected oriented
surfaces). One of the project's anti-hack theorems.

Top-down obligation: pointed to by `Jacobian/Solution.lean` for the
`genus_eq_zero_iff_homeo` lemma.

### Blocker analysis for `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere`

**Status (2026-04-27):** sorry — all three required ingredients are absent
from Mathlib v4.28.0 (commit `8f9d9cff6bd728b17a24e163c9402775d9e6a365`).

#### Proof sketch

1. **Uniqueness of smooth structure on S².** Every topological 2-sphere
   admits a unique smooth structure up to diffeomorphism (Radó 1925 /
   Morse 1960). Given `X ≃ₜ S²`, transfer the smooth structure on `X`
   (from its complex charts) to `S²` and apply uniqueness to get a
   *diffeomorphism* `X ≃ₘ S²`.
   - **Mathlib gap:** No `SmoothManifoldWithCorners` structure on
     `Metric.sphere … 1` in `ℝ³`; no smooth classification of compact
     surfaces; no `Diffeomorph` between abstract smooth manifolds and
     concrete spheres. Searched: `ComplexProjectiveLine`,
     `RiemannSphere`, `cotangentSpace_finrank` — all absent.

2. **Uniqueness of complex structure on S².** A smooth compact oriented
   2-manifold diffeomorphic to `S²` carries a unique complex structure up
   to biholomorphism (consequence of the uniformization theorem: every
   simply connected Riemann surface is biholomorphic to `ℂ`, `𝔻`, or
   `ℂℙ¹`; compactness forces `ℂℙ¹`). So `X` is biholomorphic to `ℂℙ¹`.
   - **Mathlib gap:** No uniformization theorem; no `ℂℙ¹` as a complex
     manifold; no biholomorphism API for Riemann surfaces.

3. **H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0.** On `ℂℙ¹`, the canonical sheaf `Ω¹` has
   degree `−2`. A line bundle of negative degree on a compact Riemann
   surface has no nonzero global sections. Hence the space of holomorphic
   1-forms is trivial and `analyticGenus = 0`.
   - **Mathlib gap:** No sheaf-cohomology or divisor-degree theory; no
     definition of `ℂℙ¹` as a Riemann surface; no Riemann–Roch theorem.

#### Lemmas searched in Mathlib (all absent)

- `ComplexProjectiveLine` / `RiemannSphere` — not defined.
- `Diffeomorph.ofHomeomorphSphere` — no smooth classification of surfaces.
- `cotangentSpace_finrank` — no dimension computation for cotangent spaces.
- `Module.finrank_holomorphicOneForms_sphere` — not available.
- `IsManifold.sphere` (for `Metric.sphere` in `ℝ³` with `ℂ`-charts) — absent.

#### 3-step Mathlib-API plan for a future job

**Step 1 — Define `ℂℙ¹` as a complex manifold.**
Define `ℂℙ¹` (e.g. as `Projectivization ℂ (Fin 2 → ℂ)` or as the
one-point compactification `AlexandrovCompactification ℂ`). Equip it
with `ChartedSpace ℂ` and `IsManifold` instances using the standard
two-chart atlas (`z ↦ z`, `z ↦ 1/z`). Prove it is compact, connected,
T2, and homeomorphic to `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1`.

**Step 2 — Compute `H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0` directly.**
Bypass the general Riemann–Roch machinery: show that any holomorphic
1-form on `ℂℙ¹` restricts to `f(z) dz` on the standard chart `U₀ ≅ ℂ`,
and the transition to the chart `U₁` forces `f(z) = 0` (by Liouville's
theorem applied to the resulting entire function with growth constraint).
Conclude `Subsingleton (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ ℂℙ¹)`.

**Step 3 — Transport along homeomorphism.**
For compact Riemann surfaces `X ≃ₜ ℂℙ¹`, the homeomorphism lifts to a
biholomorphism (by uniqueness of complex structure on `S²`), giving an
isomorphism of 1-form spaces. Transport the subsingleton result from
Step 2 to `X` and apply `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_subsingleton`.

An alternative shortcut for **Step 3** (avoiding uniformization): if
we only need genus 0, prove directly that `Module.finrank` of sections
of a bundle is invariant under biholomorphism, and show the
homeomorphism `X ≃ₜ S²` lifts to a biholomorphism `X ≃ₕ ℂℙ¹` using
the fact that every orientation-preserving homeomorphism between
Riemann surfaces is homotopic to a biholomorphism (Earle–Eells).
-/

/-! ### Refined decomposition of the easy direction

The easy direction `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere` is now
assembled from three smaller named obligations, each Aristotle-shaped:

* `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton` — the space of holomorphic
  1-forms on `ℂℙ¹ = OnePoint ℂ` is a subsingleton (i.e. only the zero
  form exists).  This is the substantive analytic content
  (Liouville-style argument on the inversion chart).
* `analyticGenus_onePointCx_eq_zero` — pure corollary of the subsingleton
  fact via `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_subsingleton`.
* `analyticGenus_eq_of_homeomorphic_sphere_of_onePointCx` — the
  uniformization-lite transport step: a compact Riemann surface
  homeomorphic to `S²` has the same analytic genus as `OnePoint ℂ`.
  This bundles the deep "every complex structure on `S²` is biholomorphic
  to `ℂℙ¹`" content into a single named obligation.

The original `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere` becomes pure
assembly of these three pieces. The hard direction
`homeomorphic_sphere_of_analyticGenus_eq_zero` below is unchanged.
-/

/-! #### Proof plan for `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton`

A holomorphic 1-form on `OnePoint ℂ` pulled back to
the identity chart is `f(z) dz` for some entire function `f : ℂ → ℂ`;
under the inversion-chart transition `w = z⁻¹`, it becomes
`-f(1/w) / w² dw`. Holomorphicity at `w = 0` forces `f(1/w) / w²` to be
bounded near zero, which by Liouville's theorem forces `f ≡ 0`.

This is decomposed into:
1. `entire_tendsto_zero_eq_zero` — Liouville-based vanishing of entire
   functions that tend to 0 at infinity. Available sorry-free in
   `EntireZero.lean`.
2. `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero` — the substantive
   chart-pullback + Liouville application on the identity chart
   (finite points). Carries the chart-extraction Mathlib gap.
3. `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_infty_eq_zero` — vanishing at
   the point at infinity, via the inversion chart. Continuity of the
   smooth section forces `g(0) = lim_{w→0} g(w) = 0`.
4. `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_eq_zero` — sorry-free assembly
   via `cases x using OnePoint.rec` of leaves (2) and (3).
5. `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton` — sorry-free assembly
   via `ext_toFun`. -/

/-- An entire function `f : ℂ → ℂ` that tends to `0` along `cocompact ℂ`
(i.e. as `|z| → ∞`) is identically zero.

This is the Liouville-application building block of the Liouville core.
The proof is provided sorry-free in
`Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/EntireZero.lean` as
`Differentiable.eq_zero_of_tendsto_zero_cocompact`. -/
theorem entire_tendsto_zero_eq_zero (f : ℂ → ℂ) (hf : Differentiable ℂ f)
    (h : Filter.Tendsto f (Filter.cocompact ℂ) (nhds 0)) :
    f = 0 :=
  hf.eq_zero_of_tendsto_zero_cocompact h

/-! #### Refined chart-extraction split

The original single `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_eq_zero` sorry
is now split into two named leaves keyed to the two charts of
`OnePoint ℂ` (identity chart on `{∞}ᶜ` and inversion chart on `{↑0}ᶜ`).

Both leaves carry the same chart-extraction Mathlib gap, but they are
analytically distinct: the finite-chart leaf is the substantive Liouville
application, while the infinity-chart leaf is a continuity argument
(the inversion-chart coefficient `g(w) = -f(1/w)/w²` extends across
`w = 0` to `g(0) = 0`).

Splitting them lets two separate Aristotle/sub-agent jobs target each
leaf with disjoint reasoning patterns. -/

/-!
### TOPDOWN decomposition for `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`
(integrated from Aristotle 76c01cf9)

The proof is split into two named sub-obligations + sorry-free assembly:

* `holomorphicOneForm_coeff_entire` — the coefficient function
  `holomorphicOneForm_coeff ω` is entire (carries the chart-extraction gap).
* `holomorphicOneForm_coeff_tendsto_zero` — the coefficient function tends
  to `0` along `cocompact ℂ` (carries the chart-extraction + chart-transition
  formula gap).

Assembly: apply `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_tendsto_zero_cocompact` (Liouville)
to `holomorphicOneForm_coeff ω`, then `ω.toFun (↑z) = 0` follows because
`ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` is determined by its value at `1` (via `ext`).

**Substantive content (continuity of inversion-chart coefficient).**
On the inversion chart (source `(OnePoint ℂ) \ {↑0}`, forward map
`↑z ↦ z⁻¹`, `∞ ↦ 0`), the section `ω` reads as `g(w) dw` for some
`g : ℂ → ℂ`, where `g(w) = (ω.toFun ((·⁻¹) w)) 1` for `w ≠ 0` and
`g(0) = (ω.toFun ∞) 1`.

By `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`, for `w ≠ 0`
the value `ω.toFun ↑(w⁻¹) = 0`, so `g(w) = 0` on `{w | w ≠ 0}`.
Continuity of the bundle-trivialised section at `w = 0` then forces
`g(0) = 0`, i.e. `(ω.toFun ∞) 1 = 0`. Since the cotangent fiber over
`∞` is `ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` (also determined by its value at `1`), we conclude
`ω.toFun ∞ = 0`.

**Mathlib gap:** same as the finite case — no user-facing
`ContMDiffSection` chart-trivialisation API. The continuity argument
itself is elementary once the trivialisation is set up.

**Note:** this lemma takes `holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_toFun_finite_eq_zero`

This is the "uniformization-lite" content: a topological homeomorphism

and the canonical complex structure on `OnePoint ℂ` (from
`OnePointCxIsManifold`), forces a biholomorphism `X ≃ OnePoint ℂ` (since
every complex structure on the topological 2-sphere is biholomorphic to
`ℂℙ¹` — uniformization at genus 0). The biholomorphism induces a
ℂ-linear isomorphism of holomorphic 1-form spaces, hence equality of
analytic genera.

Stated as an equality of natural numbers, since both sides are defined
once their `FiniteDimensionalHolomorphicOneForms` instances are
available (`X`'s comes from the hypothesis, `OnePoint ℂ`'s comes from

### Blocker analysis for `homeomorphic_sphere_of_analyticGenus_eq_zero`

**Status (2026-04-27):** sorry — all core ingredients are absent from
Mathlib v4.28.0 (commit `8f9d9cff6bd728b17a24e163c9402775d9e6a365`).
This is strictly harder than the easy direction; it requires the
*forward* implication of uniformization at genus 0.

#### Mathematical content

A compact connected Riemann surface `X` with `analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`
(i.e. `H⁰(X, Ω¹) = 0`, equivalently
`Subsingleton (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X)` by
`analyticGenus_eq_zero_iff_subsingleton`) is homeomorphic to `S²`.

The standard proof runs through the following chain:

1. **Genus 0 ⟹ simply connected.** By the topological classification
   of compact oriented surfaces, the topological genus equals the
   analytic genus (Hodge theory / de Rham). A compact oriented surface
   of topological genus 0 is simply connected.

2. **Simply connected compact Riemann surface ⟹ biholomorphic to ℂℙ¹.**
   The uniformization theorem says every simply connected Riemann surface
   is biholomorphic to ℂ, 𝔻, or ℂℙ¹. Compactness rules out ℂ and 𝔻.

3. **ℂℙ¹ ≃ₜ S².** The one-point compactification of ℂ (= ℂℙ¹ as a
   topological space) is homeomorphic to the standard 2-sphere in ℝ³
   via stereographic projection.

An alternative route avoids uniformization entirely by using Riemann–Roch
+ a rational function argument:

1'. **Genus 0 + Riemann–Roch ⟹ ∃ meromorphic function of degree 1.**
    With `g = 0`, Riemann–Roch gives `ℓ(D) - ℓ(K-D) ≥ deg D + 1` for
    any divisor `D`. Taking `D` = a single point gives a meromorphic
    function with a single simple pole, i.e. of degree 1.

2'. **Degree-1 meromorphic function ⟹ biholomorphism to ℂℙ¹.**
    A meromorphic function of degree 1 on a compact Riemann surface is a
    biholomorphism onto ℂℙ¹.

3'. Same as step 3.

#### 3-step Mathlib-API plan for a future job

**Step 1 — Build `ℂℙ¹` as a complex manifold and prove `ℂℙ¹ ≃ₜ S²`.**

Define `ℂℙ¹` as `OnePoint ℂ` (the Alexandrov one-point compactification
of `ℂ`). Equip it with:
- A `T2Space` instance (requires locally compact + T2 of `ℂ`, which
  Mathlib already has).
- A `ChartedSpace ℂ` instance via two charts: `z ↦ z` on `ℂ ⊂ OnePoint ℂ`
  and `z ↦ 1/z` on `(OnePoint ℂ) \ {0}`.
- An `IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) ⊤` instance by showing chart
  transitions are holomorphic (they are `z ↦ 1/z` on `ℂ \ {0}`).
- A `Homeomorph` from `OnePoint ℂ` to `Metric.sphere (0 : EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)) 1`
  by composing the identification `ℂ ≅ ℝ²` with the inverse of
  stereographic projection and extending continuously to the point at
  infinity.

**Estimated difficulty:** Medium-hard. The topological parts (compact,
connected, T2) are close to what Mathlib has for `OnePoint`. The main
work is constructing the complex atlas and proving the homeomorphism
with `S²`. The latter requires showing that `stereographic'⁻¹ ∘ (ℂ → ℝ²)`
extends continuously to a bijection `OnePoint ℂ → S²`. Roughly 300–600
lines of new Lean code.

**Step 2 — Prove `H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0` directly (no Riemann–Roch).**

Show `Subsingleton (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ (OnePoint ℂ))` by a direct
argument: a holomorphic 1-form on `OnePoint ℂ` restricts to `f(z) dz`
on the standard chart `ℂ`, where `f : ℂ → ℂ` is entire. On the chart at
infinity, the transition gives `f(z) dz = -f(1/w) / w² dw`, which must
be holomorphic at `w = 0`. By Liouville's theorem (available in Mathlib:
`Complex.liouville_theorem`), `f` is constant, and the holomorphicity
condition at infinity forces the constant to be zero.

**Estimated difficulty:** Medium. Liouville's theorem is available.
The main challenge is formalizing what "holomorphic 1-form on a charted
space" means in terms of the chart transition — this depends on the
project's `HolomorphicOneForm` API and may require additional interface
lemmas.

**Step 3 — The actual uniformization step (genus 0 ⟹ biholomorphic to ℂℙ¹).**

This is the hardest step and has two possible sub-approaches:

**(3a) Via uniformization theorem (very hard).** Prove the uniformization
theorem for compact Riemann surfaces: every simply connected Riemann
surface is biholomorphic to ℂ, 𝔻, or ℂℙ¹. This is a major theorem
requiring Perron's method, Dirichlet problem on Riemann surfaces,
normal families, and the Riemann mapping theorem. Estimated at 2000+
lines of new Lean code. Then show `genus 0 ⟹ simply connected`
(requires Hodge theory or classification of surfaces).

**(3b) Via Riemann–Roch (hard).** Prove the Riemann–Roch theorem for
compact Riemann surfaces. Then the argument is: genus 0 ⟹ degree-1
meromorphic function exists ⟹ biholomorphism to ℂℙ¹. This avoids
uniformization but requires sheaf cohomology, Serre duality, and
divisor theory. Estimated at 1500+ lines.

**(3c) Via direct Mittag-Leffler–style argument (moderately hard).**
Avoid both uniformization and full Riemann–Roch. Use the vanishing
of `H¹(X, 𝒪)` (which follows from `H⁰(X, Ω¹) = 0` by Serre duality —
but Serre duality itself is nontrivial). Then Mittag-Leffler–type
arguments produce a meromorphic function of degree 1. This still
requires substantial analytic machinery not in Mathlib.

#### Honest assessment

This theorem is **not realistically formalizable** with the current
Mathlib API (v4.28.0). The gap is enormous:

- **ℂℙ¹ as a complex manifold** does not exist. Building it (Step 1)
is a self-contained project of moderate size (~500 lines) and is the
only step that could plausibly be completed in a focused effort.

- **The uniformization theorem** (or any equivalent, such as
Riemann–Roch for Riemann surfaces) is entirely absent and represents
one of the deepest results in complex analysis / algebraic geometry.
No path through Mathlib's current API gets close.

- **The bridge from analytic genus to topological genus** (Hodge theory /
de Rham cohomology) is also absent. Without it, even the implication
"genus 0 ⟹ simply connected" cannot be stated.

- **Comparison with the easy direction:** the easy direction
(`analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere`) requires showing
`H⁰(ℂℙ¹, Ω¹) = 0`, which can be done with Steps 1–2 alone (no
uniformization). The hard direction additionally requires Step 3,
which is strictly more demanding.

**Verdict:** This theorem should be classified as a **Phase 4+ deferred
dependency**. It is a deep uniformization-level result. A realistic
formalization would require either (a) formalizing the uniformization
theorem from scratch (~2000+ lines of new Lean), or (b) formalizing
Riemann–Roch for compact Riemann surfaces (~1500+ lines). Neither is
feasible in the near term without a dedicated multi-month effort.

The sorry should remain. The `analyticGenus_eq_zero_iff_homeomorphic_sphere`
biconditional that assembles both directions will carry two sorries
(one from each direction) until the relevant Mathlib infrastructure
matures.

#### Nearest Mathlib footholds (for future work)

- `OnePoint` (one-point compactification): good starting point for
  defining `ℂℙ¹` topologically.
- `stereographic` / `stereographic'` / `EuclideanSpace.instChartedSpaceSphere`:
  real manifold structure on `S²`, needed for Step 1's homeomorphism.
- `Complex.liouville_theorem`: Liouville's theorem for bounded entire
  functions, needed for Step 2.
- `MeromorphicAt`: pointwise meromorphic function API, useful building
  block for Steps 2–3.
- `SimplyConnectedSpace`: the class exists, though no instance for `S²`.
- `IsCoveringMap` + path lifting: covering space theory, relevant if
  pursuing uniformization via universal covers.

2-sphere `S² ⊂ ℝ³`.  This uses `onePointEquivSphereOfFinrankEq` from

The current project does not yet have a global meromorphic-function type on

analytic divisor/order assertions remain in the theorem name and docstring.

### TOPDOWN decomposition for `genus_zero_homeomorph_onePointCx`

The previous single uniformization-level sorry is split into three named
obligations matching the standard Riemann-Roch route:

1. `genus_zero_exists_simplePole_meromorphicMap` — from
   `analyticGenus = 0`, Riemann-Roch produces a meromorphic function with one
   simple pole.
2. `simplePole_meromorphicMap_proper_degreeOne` — compactness/properness and
   divisor-degree bookkeeping promote that function to a proper degree-one map
   to `OnePoint ℂ`.
3. `proper_degreeOne_meromorphicMap_biholomorphic` — a proper degree-one
   holomorphic map is a biholomorphic parametrization, hence a homeomorphism.

The original `genus_zero_homeomorph_onePointCx` is now pure assembly of these
smaller leaves.
-/

/-- **Sub-obligation 1 (Riemann-Roch).** If a compact connected Riemann
surface has analytic genus zero, then there is a meromorphic function with a
single simple pole.

Bottom-up content: divisor theory on compact Riemann surfaces and the
Riemann-Roch calculation `ℓ(P) = 2` when `g = 0`, producing a nonconstant
meromorphic function whose only pole is simple and located at `P`. -/
