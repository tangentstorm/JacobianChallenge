# Entire functions vanishing at infinity are zero

Small helper file collecting two corollaries of Liouville's theorem
that are useful when proving the Liouville core of the genus-zero
classification (`holomorphicOneForm_onePointCx_subsingleton` in
`Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/GenusZeroClassification.lean`).

Both lemmas are direct corollaries of Mathlib's
`Differentiable.eq_const_of_tendsto_cocompact`. They are not in
Mathlib v4.28.0 in this exact form.

* `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_tendsto_zero_cocompact`
  — entire and tends to `0` along `cocompact ℂ` ⇒ identically `0`.
* `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_inv_decay_at_infty`
  — entire and `‖f z‖ ≤ C / ‖z‖` for `‖z‖ ≥ R` ⇒ identically `0`.
* `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_quadratic_decay_at_infty`
  — entire and `‖f z‖ ≤ C / ‖z‖^2` for `‖z‖ ≥ R` ⇒ identically `0`.
* `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_polynomial_decay_at_infty`
  — entire and `‖f z‖ ≤ C / ‖z‖^n` (any `n ≥ 1`) for `‖z‖ ≥ R`
    ⇒ identically `0`.
* `Differentiable.eq_zero_of_norm_eventually_le`
  — entire and `‖f z‖` eventually bounded by some `g z` that tends
    to `0` along `cocompact ℂ` ⇒ identically `0`.  General form
    of the decay corollaries above.

The second is the simplest growth-bound form.  The third is the
form that arises from the inversion-chart holomorphicity condition
for a holomorphic 1-form on `ℂℙ¹`; it reduces to the second via the
trivial bound `1 / ‖z‖^2 ≤ 1 / ‖z‖` for `‖z‖ ≥ 1`.  The fourth
generalizes to arbitrary positive integer powers.

The bound `‖f z‖ ≤ C / ‖z‖` is enough — the standard quadratic form
`‖f z‖ ≤ C' / ‖z‖^2` that arises from the inversion-chart
holomorphicity condition implies this since
`C' / ‖z‖^2 ≤ C' / ‖z‖` for `‖z‖ ≥ 1`. -/

`‖f z‖ ≤ C / ‖z‖^2` for `‖z‖ ≥ R` (with `C ≥ 0`), then `f` is
identically `0`.

This is the form that arises naturally from holomorphicity of a
1-form `f(z) dz` at the point at infinity in the standard two-chart
atlas of `ℂℙ¹`: the inversion-chart pullback `-f(1/w)/w² dw` is
holomorphic at `w = 0` iff `f(1/w) / w²` is bounded near `0`, i.e.
`|f(z)| ≤ C / |z|^2` for `|z|` large. -/
