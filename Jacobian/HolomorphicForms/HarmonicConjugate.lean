`u` near `x` in the sense that the chart-pullback of `f := u + iv`
(viewed as a `ℂ`-valued function via `Complex.ofReal` + `Complex.I`)
is `ℂ`-Fréchet-differentiable at the chart image of `x`. This is
exactly the Cauchy-Riemann condition recast as complex
differentiability — strictly stronger than mere `C²` smoothness;
`True`-style cheats no longer satisfy it once it is the demanded
predicate. -/

equals `z` by `Complex.re_add_im` (plus `mul_comm`), and the
identity function is trivially ℂ-Fréchet-differentiable at any

`IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal` is non-vacuous and is the intended

/-- First honest existence theorem for `IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal`.
On `X = ℂ` at any point `x`, `Complex.re` admits a genuine
harmonic conjugate — namely `Complex.im`, witnessed by `re_im_at`.

Specialized to `u = Complex.re` because that is currently the only
case our witness library covers; a general-`u` version on `X = ℂ`
would need either a constructive Poincaré-style integration or a
richer witness toolbox. Companion to the still-cheating generic
`harmonic_conjugate_exists_locally`; analogous in role to the
dipole's `existence_of_dipole_harmonic_on_complex`. -/

/-- Genuine sibling to the `True` slot in
`continuous_cr_to_holomorphic_bridge`: `f : X → ℂ` is
holomorphic-in-the-chart at `x` in the sense that the
chart-pullback `z ↦ f ((chartAt ℂ x).symm z)` is
`ℂ`-Fréchet-differentiable at the chart image of `x`.
Generic over `f`, in contrast to `IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal`
which fixes `f = u + iv`. Both predicates share the same
`HasFDerivAt`-on-ℂ semantic framework. -/

/-- Canonical witness on `X = ℂ`: the identity function is
holomorphic-in-the-chart at every point `x : ℂ`. The self-chart
`chartAt ℂ x` is `OpenPartialHomeomorph.refl ℂ`, so the chart
pullback `z ↦ id ((chart).symm z) = z` is exactly the identity,
and the identity function is trivially ℂ-Fréchet-differentiable
with derivative `ContinuousLinearMap.id`. Demonstrates that
`IsHolomorphicInChartReal` is non-vacuous; analogous to
`IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal.re_im_at`. -/

/-- Honest existence theorem for the CR-to-holomorphic bridge,
specialized to `u = Complex.re`, `v = Complex.im` on `X = ℂ`.
Exhibits `f := id : ℂ → ℂ` satisfying both the equation
`f x = ↑x.re + I * ↑x.im` (by `Complex.re_add_im` + `mul_comm`)
and `IsHolomorphicInChartReal ℂ f x` at every point (by `id_at`).

Narrowed to the canonical `re/im` pair because that is the only
case our witness library covers; a generic version covering
arbitrary `(u, v)` with the right CR data would need a much
richer witness library. Companion to the still-cheating generic
`continuous_cr_to_holomorphic_bridge`; analogous in role to
`existence_of_harmonic_conjugate_for_re_on_complex` and to
`existence_of_dipole_harmonic_on_complex`. -/

/-- Genuine sibling to the `True`-stub `IsHarmonicOff`: at every
point off the singular set `{P, Q}`, `u` admits a local harmonic
conjugate (in the contentful `IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal` sense).
On simply-connected charts this is mathematically equivalent to
classical harmonicity (`Δu = 0`), but stated this way it stays
within our existing `HasFDerivAt`-on-ℂ semantic framework and
avoids `iteratedFDeriv ℝ 2` plumbing. `True`-style cheats no
longer satisfy it once it is the demanded predicate.

Lives in `HarmonicConjugate.lean` rather than `HarmonicDipole.lean`
because it references `IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal`, which is
defined here. -/

/-- Canonical witness on `X = ℂ`: the real-part function `Complex.re`
is harmonic-off `{P, Q}` for ANY pair `P, Q : ℂ`. At every point
`x : ℂ` (including the supposedly-excluded `P` and `Q` themselves)
the conjugate `Complex.im` works via `re_im_at x`. Demonstrates
that `IsHarmonicOffReal` is non-vacuous; analogous to
`IsHarmonicConjugateAtReal.re_im_at` and to
`IsHolomorphicInChartReal.id_at`. -/

/-- Honest existence theorem for `IsHarmonicOffReal`, specialized
on `X = ℂ`. For any `P, Q : ℂ`, exhibit a `u : ℂ → ℝ` (namely
`Complex.re`) genuinely satisfying `IsHarmonicOffReal ℂ P Q u`.
Proof is the one-line tuple ⟨Complex.re, re_off P Q⟩.

Fourth honest existential in the project. Mirrors:
- existence_of_dipole_harmonic_on_complex (9aaa54d7) — dipole track
- existence_of_harmonic_conjugate_for_re_on_complex (95367526) — Stub 1
- existence_of_continuous_cr_to_holomorphic_for_re_im_on_complex (33db01e9) — Stub 2

Specialized to the witness `Complex.re` because that is currently
the only `IsHarmonicOffReal` witness; a generic-`u` version on
`X = ℂ` would require richer harmonic-conjugate machinery
(Complex.log/arg pair for the canonical dipole, plus closure
lemmas), which is a multi-commit follow-up. Does not touch the
still-cheating generic `existence_of_dipole_harmonic`. -/

Real differentiability plus Cauchy-Riemann equations implies complex differentiability.
