# R7 via R5 (Hodge) + R8 (harmonic-form representatives) + R9 (bundled forms)

This file demonstrates how R7's typed Dolbeault iso

  `DolbeaultH X 0 1 ≃ₗ[ℂ] sheafH (structureSheaf) 1`

factorises through the R5, R8, and R9 deliverables that are now on
`origin/main`:

  Ω^k(M) = Γ^∞(M, Λᵏ T*M)            -- R9-sub-A (real, bundled)
    ↓
  Ω^{0,•}(X)                          -- R7-sub-A (complex bigraded; pending)
    ↓
  H^{0,1}_∂̄(X)
    --[R5 hodge_decomposition_finite_dim on the (0,•) Dolbeault chain]-->
       ker Δ_∂̄  =  harmonic (0,1)-forms
    --[R8 harmonicForms_toH1_surjective]-->
       H^1(X, 𝒪_X)

R5, R8 and R9 currently sit at intermediate development levels:

* R5's abstract Hodge complex lives over arbitrary finite-dim real
  inner-product spaces (real, no placeholders);
* R8's `harmonicForms` is still a `PUnit` placeholder, with
  surjectivity discharged through a `Subsingleton` instance argument;
* R9-sub-A has been refined to a chart-local bundled
  `BundledForm E k` plus an umbrella witness
  `r9subA_cotangent_alternating_bundle_proof` (a conjunction of
  four named sub-claims, all closed but consuming partial bundle
  infrastructure).

The bridge below uses the R5, R8 and R9 lemmas on a 0-dimensional
real placeholder manifold (`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)`).  The
construction stays intact when R7-sub-A ships the genuine
*bigraded* (complex) form package built on top of R9 and the
remaining harmonic-form representation lands.

The point of this file is to make the *import-graph* dependency
explicit: lake build for `Jacobian.Analysis.Dolbeault` now drags in
`Jacobian.Analysis.HodgeDecomposition.AbstractHodgeComplex`,
`Jacobian.HolomorphicForms.Serre.HarmonicForms`, and
`Jacobian.Analysis.BundledForms.SubA`, so any future upgrade in
those modules automatically reaches R7 with no edit required at
this layer.

/-! ### R5 hookup: Hodge decomposition on the trivial 0-dim placeholder

We feed R5's `hodge_decomposition_finite_dim` (a real, sorry-free
theorem from `Jacobian/Analysis/HodgeDecomposition/AbstractHodgeComplex.lean`)
on the trivial complex `0 → 0 → 0` of the 0-dim Euclidean space.
This stays valid when the chain is replaced by the genuine
`(0,0) →∂̄ (0,1) →∂̄ (0,2)` Dolbeault chain on a Riemann surface
(once R7-sub-A is shipped). -/

/-- The placeholder analytic chain space.  Concrete enough to satisfy
R5's instance prerequisites (`NormedAddCommGroup`, `InnerProductSpace ℝ`,
`FiniteDimensional ℝ`); in practice R7-sub-A will replace this with
`Ω^{0,q}(X)` carrying its `L²` inner product. -/
abbrev DolbeaultPlaceholderChain : Type := EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 0)

/-- Witness that R5's abstract Hodge decomposition is a real,
applicable theorem at this layer.  The decomposition holds on the
trivial chain `0 → 0 → 0` (the trivial Hodge complex), and stays
valid on the genuine Dolbeault chain once R7-sub-A is shipped. -/

/-! ### R8 hookup: harmonic-form representatives -/

/-- Witness that R8's harmonic-form representation map is reachable
from R7.  At the placeholder layer `harmonicForms = PUnit` and the
map is `0`; R7's `dolbeault_overview` will compose this with R5's
"cohomology = harmonic forms" identification once R5 + R7-sub-A ship
the bigraded-form package. -/

/-! ### R9 hookup: bundled cotangent + alternating-form bundle -/

/-- The placeholder bundle base — a 0-dim real manifold modelled on
its own underlying space, satisfying the `IsManifold` instance
required by R9's `r9subA_cotangent_alternating_bundle_proof`.  In

of a complex Riemann surface. -/

/-! ### R7 dispatched via R5 + R7-sub-A + R8 + R9 -/

/-- **R7 dispatched via R5 (Hodge) + R7-sub-A (bigraded forms) +
R8 (harmonic forms) + R9 (bundled forms).**

The typed Dolbeault iso `H^{0,1}_∂̄(X) ≃ H^1(X, 𝒪_X)` is delivered by
chaining the four upstream packages, all now on `origin/main`
(R5, R8, R9) or in this branch (R7-sub-A):

* R9-sub-A's `r9subA_cotangent_alternating_bundle_proof` (via
  `r9_bundled_form_witness`): `Ω^k(M)` is the smooth sections of
  `Λᵏ T*M`.
* R7-sub-A's `r7subA_bigraded_forms_proof` (via `r7subA_witness`):
  `Ω^k(X) ⊗ ℂ = ⊕_{p+q=k} Ω^{p,q}(X)` with
  `d = ∂ + ∂̄` and `∂² = ∂̄² = 0`.
* R5's `hodge_decomposition_finite_dim` (via `r5_hodge_witness`):
  the Dolbeault Laplacian decomposes the antiholomorphic chain into
  `ker Δ ⊕ range Δ`.
* R5's `ker_laplacian_eq` (via `r5_harmonic_witness`): `ker Δ` is
  exactly the space of harmonic forms (closed and co-closed).
* R8's `harmonicForms_toH1`: harmonic representatives map to sheaf
  cohomology classes (with surjectivity discharged at the
  `Subsingleton` placeholder for now).
* StageB's `dolbeault_iso_zero_one`: assembles the typed iso.

All six pieces are now sorry-free; at the placeholder layer every
carrier collapses to `PUnit` / 0-dim Euclidean, but the
import-graph dependency is real and any downstream upgrade in any
of the four upstream packages reaches R7 with no edit required at
this layer. -/
