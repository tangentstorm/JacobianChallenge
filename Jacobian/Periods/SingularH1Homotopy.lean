# Round 46 — Homotopy invariance of singular `H₁`

This module refines the frontier leaf
`JacobianChallenge.Periods.singularH1_iso_of_homotopyEquiv`
(in `Jacobian/Periods/SurfaceClassification.lean`) into the two
classical sub-obligations of the chain-level prism construction:

* `singularChain_homotopy_chainHomotopy` — the prism construction
  produces a ℤ-linear chain homotopy between the singular-chain
  functors evaluated at homotopic continuous maps.
* `chainHomotopic_descends_to_homologyEq` — chain homotopy implies the
  induced maps on `H_n` agree, hence a homotopy equivalence yields an
  isomorphism on `H_n`.

Plus a sorry-free assembly:

* `singularH1_iso_of_homotopyEquiv_via_prism` — extracts the iso from
  the two leaves above and specialises to `n = 1`.

Each leaf is itself a `sorry`; this round only performs the top-down
split. Mathlib v4.28.0 does not have either piece packaged at the
required level (it has `singularSet`/`singularChainComplex` but not
the prism/chain-homotopy descent on `singularHomologyFunctor`).

## Bottom-up content

* **Prism.** Standard simplex-by-simplex prism construction
  ([Hatcher §2.1, Lemma 2.10]; [Spanier IV.4]). Given `H : f ≃ₕ g`
  and a singular `n`-simplex `σ : Δⁿ → X`, build `n+1` singular
  `(n+1)`-simplices in `Y` via the prism `Δⁿ × I → Y`,
  `(t, s) ↦ H(σ t, s)`. Sum with alternating signs gives the
  homotopy operator `P_n : C_n(X) → C_{n+1}(Y)`. The boundary identity
  `∂P + P∂ = g_* − f_*` is the verification.
* **Descent to homology.** Standard homological algebra: if `f, g : C ⟶ D`
  are chain-homotopic, then `H_n(f) = H_n(g)`. Applied at `n = 1` and
  using a homotopy inverse to invert the comparison gives the desired
  iso. Mathlib has `HomotopyCategory` machinery; bridging into the
  concrete `singularHomologyFunctor` from
  `AlgebraicTopology.SingularHomology` requires a chain.

Given the prism datum produced by `singularChain_homotopy_chainHomotopy`,

Bottom-up content: the boundary identity `∂P + P∂ = g_* − f_*` makes
the difference of the homology-induced maps a chain boundary, hence
zero on homology. -/
