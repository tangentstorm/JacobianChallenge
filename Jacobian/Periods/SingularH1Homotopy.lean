# Round 46 — Homotopy invariance of singular `H₁`

This module refines the frontier leaf
`JacobianChallenge.Periods.singularH1_iso_of_homotopyEquiv`
(in `Jacobian/Periods/SurfaceClassification.lean`) into the two
classical sub-obligations of the chain-level prism construction:

* `singularChain_homotopy_chainHomotopy` — the prism construction
  produces a ℤ-linear chain homotopy between the singular-chain
  functors evaluated at homotopic continuous maps.
* `chainHomotopic_descends_to_homologyEq` — chain homotopy implies the
  induced maps on `H_n` agree, hence a homotopy equivalence yields an
  isomorphism on `H_n`.

Plus a sorry-free assembly:

* `singularH1_iso_of_homotopyEquiv_via_prism` — extracts the iso from
  the two leaves above and specialises to `n = 1`.

Each leaf is itself a `sorry`; this round only performs the top-down
split. Mathlib v4.28.0 does not have either piece packaged at the
required level (it has `singularSet`/`singularChainComplex` but not
the prism/chain-homotopy descent on `singularHomologyFunctor`).

## Bottom-up content

* **Prism.** Standard simplex-by-simplex prism construction
  ([Hatcher §2.1, Lemma 2.10]; [Spanier IV.4]). Given `H : f ≃ₕ g`
  and a singular `n`-simplex `σ : Δⁿ → X`, build `n+1` singular
  `(n+1)`-simplices in `Y` via the prism `Δⁿ × I → Y`,
  `(t, s) ↦ H(σ t, s)`. Sum with alternating signs gives the
  homotopy operator `P_n : C_n(X) → C_{n+1}(Y)`. The boundary identity
  `∂P + P∂ = g_* − f_*` is the verification.
* **Descent to homology.** Standard homological algebra: if `f, g : C ⟶ D`
  are chain-homotopic, then `H_n(f) = H_n(g)`. Applied at `n = 1` and
  using a homotopy inverse to invert the comparison gives the desired
  iso. Mathlib has `HomotopyCategory` machinery; bridging into the
  concrete `singularHomologyFunctor` from
  `AlgebraicTopology.SingularHomology` requires a chain.

/-! ### Round 1 (2026-05-05) — split the homotopy-equivalence iso

The original single sorry is replaced by a body delegating to two
named obligations:

* `singularH1_inducedMap_pair_of_homotopyEquiv` — produces the pair of
  maps `(f_*, g_*)` with the *propositional* mutual-inverse data
  (chain-level prism applied at `g ∘ f ≃ id` and `f ∘ g ≃ id`);
* `singularH1_iso_assemble_of_inducedMap_pair` — sorry-free assembly
  packaging an inverse-pair into a `LinearEquiv`.

This isolates the genuine prism-descent content into a single named
obligation. -/

/-- **Stage A leaf (round 1, 2026-05-05).** Bundle of the two induced
maps `f_* : H₁ X → H₁ Y` and `g_* : H₁ Y → H₁ X` together with the
mutual-inverse propositions. Bottom-up: the prism construction
applied to `g ∘ f ≃ id` and `f ∘ g ≃ id` yields the chain-level
homotopies whose descent to `H₁` makes the pair mutual inverses. -/
structure SingularH1InvPair (X Y : Type) [TopologicalSpace X]
    [TopologicalSpace Y] : Type where
  /-- Forward map `H₁ X → H₁ Y`. -/
  fwd : singularH1 X →ₗ[ℤ] singularH1 Y
  /-- Backward map `H₁ Y → H₁ X`. -/
  bwd : singularH1 Y →ₗ[ℤ] singularH1 X
  /-- The composition `bwd ∘ fwd` is the identity on `H₁ X`. -/
  left_inv : Function.LeftInverse bwd fwd
  /-- The composition `fwd ∘ bwd` is the identity on `H₁ Y`. -/
  right_inv : Function.RightInverse bwd fwd

/-! ### Round 2 (2026-05-05) — split inverse-pair into four leaves

The inverse-pair existence is split into four named obligations
mirroring its four fields:

* forward map `f_*` (genuine sorry: descend `singularChainComplexFunctor.map f`
  to `H₁`);
* backward map `g_*` (genuine sorry: same on the inverse direction);
* left-inverse identity `g_* ∘ f_* = id` (genuine sorry: chain-homotopy
  for `g ∘ f ≃ id` descends to identity on `H₁`);
* right-inverse identity `f_* ∘ g_* = id` (genuine sorry: same for the
  other composition).

The first two are unified into one helper because both go through the
same induced-map construction. -/

/-! ### Round 3 (2026-05-05) — make the induced-map opaque

The placeholder `singularH1_inducedLinearMap _ := 0` makes the
`_id`, `_comp`, `_eq_of_homotopic` lemmas *false* on non-trivial
spaces (since `0 ≠ id` whenever `singularH1 X` is non-zero). To make
the named obligations consistent with their statements (so that any
future concrete realisation of the chain functor discharges them
truthfully), we promote the definition to `noncomputable opaque`. -/

/-- **Stage A leaf (round 3).** The induced map `singularH1 X →ₗ[ℤ] singularH1 Y`
from a continuous map `f : X → Y`. Bottom-up: composition of
`singularChainComplexFunctor.map (TopCat.ofHom f)` with the descent
of degree-1 cycles modulo boundaries. Marked `opaque` so that the
companion lemmas (`_id`, `_comp`, `_eq_of_homotopic`) are not
contradicted by any specific placeholder value. -/
