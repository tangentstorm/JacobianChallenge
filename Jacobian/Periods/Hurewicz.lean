# Project-side Hurewicz and cellular-to-singular bridge

This file names the comparison theorem missing from Mathlib v4.28.0:
cellular homology agrees with singular homology for the cellular model
of the fundamental polygon.  It is deliberately stated at the narrow
surface needed by the Jacobian project.

/-- **Comparison leaf.** Cellular homology of the standard polygonal CW
model agrees with singular homology.  Bottom-up route: build the
cellular filtration spectral sequence / cellular chain comparison map
for this finite CW complex, or equivalently use Hatcher's cellular
homology theorem specialised to one zero-cell, `2g` one-cells, and one
two-cell. -/
