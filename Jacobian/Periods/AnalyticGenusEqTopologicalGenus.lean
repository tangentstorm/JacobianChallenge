# Stage B umbrella: analytic genus equals topological genus

This file states the **Stage B** obligation of
`ref/plans/polygonal-model.md`: on a compact connected Riemann surface,
the analytic genus (dimension of the space of holomorphic 1-forms)
equals the topological genus (half the ℤ-rank of singular `H₁`).

## Top-down role

`analyticGenus_eq_topologicalGenus` is the named obligation that the
umbrella `polygonal_model` delegates to in order to translate between
the analytic genus that appears in the challenge hypothesis and the
topological genus that appears in the conclusion of Stage A.

Refined into a single named ℤ-rank leaf:

* `singularH1_finrank_eq_two_mul_analyticGenus` — for a compact
  connected Riemann surface `X`,
  `Module.finrank ℤ (singularH1 X) = 2 * analyticGenus ℂ X`.

The umbrella body just unfolds `topologicalGenus`, rewrites by the
leaf, and divides by 2.

## Bottom-up content of the leaf

Two classical proof routes are available:

* **Hodge route.** `H¹(X, ℝ) ≃ H^{1,0}(X) ⊕ H^{0,1}(X)` with
  `dim H^{1,0} = dim H^{0,1} = g`. This requires Dolbeault cohomology
  on Riemann surfaces, which Mathlib v4.28.0 lacks.
* **De Rham + Riemann–Roch route.** Combine Stokes-on-RS with
  Riemann–Roch (planned in `ref/plans/stokes-on-rs-with-boundary.md`
  and `input:riemann-roch`) to compare `H¹_{dR}` and `H⁰(K)`.
* **Period-lattice route (project-internal).** The project's
  `periodSubgroup` is a `ℤ`-lattice of rank `2g` inside
  `HolomorphicOneFormDual ℂ X`; singular `H₁` maps isomorphically
  onto it (period pairing). Rank-of-period-lattice computations live
  in `Jacobian.Periods.PeriodFunctional`.

/-- **Stage B leaf.** On a compact connected Riemann surface,
the ℤ-rank of singular `H₁` equals `2g` where `g = analyticGenus ℂ X`.

Bottom-up: any of the three proof routes named in the file docstring
works (Hodge, de Rham + Riemann–Roch, or project-internal
period-lattice). All bottom out in the same arithmetic fact about the
period subgroup of `HolomorphicOneFormDual ℂ X`.

**Note (meet-in-the-middle):** the project also has a parallel
sorry'd statement `hodge_deRham_rank_eq` in
`Jacobian.Periods.PeriodFunctional` over the project-internal
`IntegralOneCycle X` (definitionally equal to `singularH1 X` modulo
the `ModuleCat ℤ` coercion). When the duplicate `topologicalGenus`
definition in `PeriodFunctional` is unified with the canonical
`Jacobian.Periods.TopologicalGenus.topologicalGenus`, this leaf can
be discharged by a thin `.symm` wrapper around `hodge_deRham_rank_eq`. -/
