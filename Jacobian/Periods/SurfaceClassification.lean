# Stage A umbrella: surface classification

This file states the **Stage A** obligation of `ref/plans/polygonal-model.md`:
every compact connected orientable smooth real 2-manifold `M` is
homeomorphic to the standard fundamental polygon `Polygon4g`
of its topological genus.

## Top-down role

`compactOrientableSurface_homeomorph_polygon4g_topologicalGenus`
is the named obligation that the umbrella `polygonal_model`
delegates to. It is a 3-leaf assembly:

* `existsHomeoToPolygon4g` — *some* `g' : ℕ` admits `M ≃ₜ Polygon4g g'`.
  This is the heart of the surface-classification theorem: Radó +
  combinatorial reduction + identification with `Polygon4g`.
* `topologicalGenus_polygon4g` — for `g : ℕ`, the polygon `Polygon4g g`
  has topological genus `g`. (Computational; reduces to `H₁` of the
  CW-quotient.)
* `topologicalGenus_homeo_invariant` — `topologicalGenus` is a
  homeomorphism invariant. (Pure Mathlib singular-homology functoriality.)

The umbrella body assembles these: `existsHomeoToPolygon4g` produces
some `g'` and a homeomorphism, then invariance + the polygon
computation pin down `g' = topologicalGenus M`, after which the
homeomorphism is rewritten into the canonical form.

## Bottom-up content

A canonical Lean discharge of `existsHomeoToPolygon4g` would proceed via:

* `compact_2manifold_admits_triangulation` (Radó),
* `triangulated_orientable_surface_word` (combinatorial reduction to the
  standard `a₁b₁a₁⁻¹b₁⁻¹⋯` edge word),
* `polygon_word_to_polygon4g` (identification with `Polygon4g g`).

Each leaf is itself a multi-hundred-LOC project; see
`ref/plans/polygonal-model.md` Stage A and the future
`ref/plans/surface-classification.md` for the next-level decomposition.

theorem for `singularHomologyFunctor`. Once it lands, the discharge
is functoriality of the functor on the homotopy equivalence.

Body: extract the basis from `polygon4g_succ_singularH1_basis` and

`singularH1_compactRiemannSurface_iso_freeZ`.)

Bottom-up routes for the underlying basis:

  `2(g+1)` edges (`a₀,b₀,…,a_g,b_g`), and one 2-cell whose attaching
  word is `∏ᵢ[aᵢ,bᵢ]`. The cellular boundary `∂₂` sends the 2-cell to
  the abelianized commutator product, which is zero, so
  `H₁ = ker ∂₁ / im ∂₂ = ℤ^{2(g+1)} / 0`. Mathlib v4.28.0 lacks
  cellular homology of CW complexes packaged as a `singularHomology`-
  comparable module.
* **Hurewicz route.** `H₁(X, ℤ) ≃ π₁(X)^{ab}` for path-connected `X`,
  combined with the surface-group abelianization computation. Mathlib
  v4.28.0 has `FundamentalGroup` but no Hurewicz isomorphism with
