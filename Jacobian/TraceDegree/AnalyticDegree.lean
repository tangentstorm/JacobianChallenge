# Analytic degree and the trace–pullback identity

The degree of a holomorphic map between compact Riemann surfaces, in
its analytic incarnation, plus the trace–pullback identity that
underlies `Jacobian/Solution.lean`'s `pushforward_pullback` lemma.

Named obligations:

* `analyticDegree f hf` — the degree of `f` (data, `opaque`,
  ℕ-valued: `0` if constant, otherwise the usual branched-cover
  degree);
* `analyticPushforward_analyticPullback` — the trace–pullback
  identity, in basis-aligned form:
  `analyticPushforward (analyticPullback Q) = analyticDegree • Q`.

Bottom-up content: degree is the generic-fiber cardinality (with
ramification multiplicity); the trace–pullback identity is the
classical `tr_f (f* η) = deg(f) · η` for holomorphic 1-forms,
descended through the period quotient.

/- The trace–pullback identity, in basis-aligned form: pushforward
of pullback equals degree-multiplication on `BasisAnalyticJacobian Y`.

Top-down obligation. Bottom-up: descend the classical trace–pullback
identity `tr_f (f* η) = deg(f) · η` (on holomorphic 1-forms) through
the period quotient.

### Blocker analysis for `analyticPushforward_analyticPullback`

**Goal.** Show that
```
analyticPushforward f hf (analyticPullback f hf Q) = (analyticDegree f hf) • Q
```
for every `Q : BasisAnalyticJacobian Y`, where:

* `analyticPullback` is `noncomputable opaque` declared in
  `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean` (line ~54);
* `analyticPushforward` is `noncomputable opaque` declared in
  `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PushforwardBasis.lean` (line ~46);
* `analyticDegree` is `opaque` declared at the top of THIS file (line ~46).

This is the *trace–pullback identity*, one of the four anti-hack
theorems of the Jacobian challenge. It forces the degree theory to
interact with pushforward/pullback through the classical formula
`trₓ(f*η) = deg(f) · η` for holomorphic 1-forms, ruling out arbitrary
homomorphism-level hacks.

#### Step-by-step mathematical proof outline

1. **Branched covering decomposition.** A nonconstant holomorphic map
   `f : X → Y` between compact Riemann surfaces is a finite branched
   covering of degree `n = deg(f)`. There is a finite branch locus
   `B ⊂ Y` (the image of the ramification divisor) such that
   `f⁻¹(Y \ B) → (Y \ B)` is an `n`-sheeted covering space.

2. **Fiber cardinality.** For each `y ∈ Y \ B`, the fiber `f⁻¹(y)`
   consists of exactly `n` distinct points `x₁, …, xₙ`.

3. **Pullback at fiber level.** For a holomorphic 1-form `η` on `Y`,
   the pullback `f*η` satisfies `(f*η)ₓ = (mfderiv f x)* ηf(x)` at
   each `x ∈ X`. That is, the value at `x` is the cotangent-map
   pullback of the value at `f(x)`.

4. **Trace summation.** The trace (pushforward) at a regular value
   `y ∈ Y \ B` sums over the fiber:
   `(trₓ f*η)_y = Σ_{x ∈ f⁻¹(y)} (push of f*η at x)_y`.
   Since each summand recovers `η_y` via the chain rule cancellation
   `(mfderiv f x)⁻¹* ∘ (mfderiv f x)* = id`, the sum yields `n · η_y`.

5. **Extension across the branch locus.** The identity
   `trₓ(f*η) = n · η` holds on `Y \ B` (a dense open subset). Both
   sides are holomorphic 1-forms on `Y`, and a holomorphic 1-form on a
   connected Riemann surface is determined by its values on a dense
   open. Hence the identity holds on all of `Y`.

6. **Descent through the period quotient.** The identity on 1-forms
   descends to the basis-aligned Jacobian carriers
   `BasisAnalyticJacobian Y` (which are quotients of the dual of the
   space of holomorphic 1-forms by the period lattice). The scalar
   multiplication `n • Q` on the torus quotient corresponds to
   `n • η` on 1-forms under the period map.

#### Mathlib lemmas surveyed (v4.28.0)

| Concept needed | Mathlib name / status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Degree of holomorphic map | **PARTIALLY PROVED** | Project-local `branchedDegree` exists in `HolomorphicForms/BranchedCover.lean`. Connected to `analyticDegree` via `analyticDegree_eq_branchedDegree`. |
| Branched covering | **PARTIALLY PROVED** | Project-local `BranchedCoverData` exists. Analytic constructor `branchedCoverData_of_nonconstant_holomorphic` is implemented. |
| Pullback of forms | **PROVED** | `pullbackFormsBundled` implemented in `HolomorphicForms/PullbackBundled.lean`. |
| Trace of forms | **STUBBED** | `traceFormsBundled` stubbed in `HolomorphicForms/TraceBundled.lean`. |
| Trace–pullback identity | **STUBBED** | `trace_pullback_identity` in `HolomorphicForms/TraceBundled.lean`. |

#### Blockers

The primary blocker is now the **smoothness of the trace map** and the
**proof of the trace–pullback identity** at the form level. The
basis-aligned assembly is now structurally sound and delegates to
these two analytic gaps.

follows from the form-level identity `traceFormsBundled f hf (pullbackFormsBundled f hf η) = d • η`
