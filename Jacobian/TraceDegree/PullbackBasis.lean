# Analytic pullback on the basis-aligned carrier

The basis-aligned analytic Jacobian `BasisAnalyticJacobian X` (defined in
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AnalyticOfCurveBasis.lean`) is a complex torus
quotient. A holomorphic map `f : X → Y` of compact Riemann surfaces
induces a pullback `f* : BasisAnalyticJacobian Y → BasisAnalyticJacobian X`
through the dual of the form pullback, descended through the period
quotient.

This module exposes the pullback as a small set of named obligations
that the top-down refinement of `Solution.pullback` (and its
functoriality lemmas) delegates to. Following the project's preference
for *small* named obligations:

* `analyticPullback f hf` — the pullback as a continuous additive
  homomorphism on the basis-aligned carrier (data, `opaque`);
* `analyticPullback_id` — pullback along the identity map is the
  identity (named sorry);
* `analyticPullback_comp` — pullback distributes over composition,
  contravariantly (named sorry);
* `analyticPullback_contMDiff` — the pullback is holomorphic (named
  sorry).

Bottom-up content: each is the descent through periods of the
corresponding identity on `(Fin g_Y → ℂ) →L[ℂ] (Fin g_X → ℂ)` linear
maps (the dual of holomorphic-form pullback in basis coordinates).

/-- The analytic pullback induced by a holomorphic map of compact
Riemann surfaces, on the basis-aligned carrier.

Top-down obligation. Bottom-up: dualize the basis-aligned pullback of
holomorphic 1-forms (`PullbackForms` in basis coordinates), then descend
through the period quotient (using period-preservation). -/

homomorphism (as a `ContinuousAddMonoidHom`).

Bottom-up: pullback of forms along `id` is the identity on forms;
descent through the period quotient preserves this. -/

/-- Companion spec for `analyticPullback_comp_apply`: pullback of forms is
contravariantly functorial, and descent preserves composition.

Bottom-up content: this is the named bottom-up obligation that
`analyticPullback_comp_apply` (and any other lemma needing contravariant
functoriality of the pullback) delegates to.  A real proof requires the
descent through the period quotient of the contravariant functoriality
of `pullbackForms` in basis coordinates. -/
