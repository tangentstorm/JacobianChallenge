# Analytic pullback on the basis-aligned carrier

The basis-aligned analytic Jacobian `BasisAnalyticJacobian X` (defined in
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AnalyticOfCurveBasis.lean`) is a complex torus
quotient. A holomorphic map `f : X → Y` of compact Riemann surfaces
induces a pullback `f* : BasisAnalyticJacobian Y → BasisAnalyticJacobian X`
through the dual of the form pullback, descended through the period
quotient.

This module exposes the pullback as a small set of named obligations
that the top-down refinement of `Solution.pullback` (and its
functoriality lemmas) delegates to. Following the project's preference
for *small* named obligations:

* `analyticPullback f hf` — the pullback as a continuous additive
  homomorphism on the basis-aligned carrier (data, `opaque`);
* `analyticPullback_id` — pullback along the identity map is the
  identity (named sorry);
* `analyticPullback_comp` — pullback distributes over composition,
  contravariantly (named sorry);
* `analyticPullback_contMDiff` — the pullback is holomorphic (named
  sorry).

Bottom-up content: each is the descent through periods of the
corresponding identity on `(Fin g_Y → ℂ) →L[ℂ] (Fin g_X → ℂ)` linear
maps (the dual of holomorphic-form pullback in basis coordinates).

/-- Bundle carrying the analytic pullback together with its
covering-space representative `basisDualPullback` and the descent
compatibility axiom `mk_eq`.

The `analyticPullback` field is the bundled `→ₜ+` hom on the
basis-aligned carrier; the `basisDualPullback` field is the additive
hom on the covering space; `mk_eq` is the defining property linking
the two: `analyticPullback (mk v) = mk (basisDualPullback v)`.

Bottom-up: concretising `basisDualPullback` requires the dual of the
basis-aligned form-pullback; `analyticPullback` is then its descent
through the period quotient (using period-preservation), and `mk_eq`
is automatic from the descent. -/

/-! ### Deeper companions for contravariant functoriality

The opaque `analyticPullback` is the descent through the period
quotient of a linear map on the covering space — the dual of the
basis-aligned form-pullback. The two specs below capture that
relationship:

* `basisDualPullback` — the additive group homomorphism on the
  covering space (opaque data);
* `analyticPullback_mk_eq` — descent compatibility (sorry);
* `basisDualPullback_comp` — form-pullback contravariance (sorry).

  (basisAnalyticPullbackBundle f hf).basisDualPullback

/-! ### Bundle-primitive split (mirrors PushforwardBasis pattern)

The opaque `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle f hf` is selected independently
by `Classical.choice` for each `(f, hf)`, so Lean has no intrinsic
propositional relationship between the dual pullbacks for `f`, `g`, and
`g ∘ f`. The mathematical relationships — `(id)* = id` and contravariant
`(g ∘ f)* = f* ∘ g*` for the dual of the basis-aligned form-pullback —
are unavailable in the pinned Mathlib (no concrete `pullbackFormsMap`).

The two sorries that remain in this file therefore sit on
*bundle-level* `AddMonoidHom`-equalities (canonical mathematical
statements that the eventual concrete `pullbackFormsMap` fix will
discharge directly), and the per-vector / per-coordinate spec lemmas
are sorry-free assemblies via `unfold + rw + rfl`. -/

/-! ### Round 1 (2026-05-05) — split the HEq diamond sorries

The two diamond sorries
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_id_dualPullback` and
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_comp_dualPullback` cannot be discharged
without a concrete (non-opaque) realisation of the per-(f, hf)
bundle. We split each into:

* `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_eq_pullbackFormsMap` — bridge from the
  bundle's `basisDualPullback` field to a *named* covering-space
  dual-pullback function `pullbackFormsMap` (currently both are
  opaque-realised; bridge is itself a sorry);
* `pullbackFormsMap_id` — identity functoriality of the bridge map;
* `pullbackFormsMap_comp` — composition functoriality.

Each is the same Mathlib gap (concrete dual of basis-aligned form
pullback) but stated as a separate, smaller named obligation. -/

/-- **Stage A leaf (round 2, concretised).** Concrete dual of the
basis-aligned form pullback, defined as `holomorphicTraceCoord f hf`
(the basis-coordinate representation of the holomorphic-1-form
pullback `f^* : H⁰(Y, Ω¹) → H⁰(X, Ω¹)`) coerced to a `→+`.

This concretisation collapses both `pullbackFormsMap_id_eq_id` and
`pullbackFormsMap_comp_eq` to sorry-free assemblies, riding on the
sorry-free `holomorphicTraceCoord_id` and `holomorphicTraceCoord_comp`
in `PushforwardBasis.lean`. The `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_eq_pullbackFormsMap`
bridge remains a (single) sorry because `basisAnalyticPullbackBundle`
itself is still `noncomputable opaque` — concretising the bundle
requires lattice preservation for `holomorphicTraceCoord`, which is
genuinely Mathlib-gap-bound (Stokes naturality on the pullback side,
analogous to the pushforward-side `pushforwardTraceLift_preserves_lattice_raw`). -/

/-- **Stage A leaf (round 1, bridge sorry).** The bundle's
`basisDualPullback` agrees with the named `pullbackFormsMap`. Same
upstream Mathlib gap as the original diamond sorry:
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle f hf` is `noncomputable opaque`
(arbitrary witness from `Inhabited`), so its `basisDualPullback`
field is not provably equal to the concrete
`(holomorphicTraceCoord f hf).toAddMonoidHom`. Concretising the
bundle requires the lattice-preservation analogue
`holomorphicTraceCoord_preserves_lattice` (Mathlib-gap-bound:
Stokes-naturality of `periodPairing` on the contravariant side,
parallel to `pushforwardTraceLift_preserves_lattice_raw`). -/

Contravariant functoriality of the dual form-pullback on the

Bottom-up content: the dual of form-pullback reverses composition.
This is the lifting of `pullbackFormsFun_comp_apply` to the
basis-aligned linear maps, then dualization.

### Blocker analysis (integrated from Aristotle ad278fcd)

**Goal.** Show that the covering-space dual pullback for `g ∘ f`
equals the composition of dual pullbacks for `f` and `g`
(contravariantly), at each covering-space vector.

**Root cause: three independent opaques.** The three
`basisDualPullback` values appearing in this equation originate
from three distinct opaque values:
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle (g ∘ f) (hg.comp hf)`,
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle f hf`, and
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle g hg`. Each `opaque` is selected
independently by `Classical.choice` from the `Inhabited` witness
(which uses `basisDualPullback := 0`), so Lean has no propositional
relationship between the three covering-space lifts.

**Why `mk_eq` is insufficient.** The `mk_eq` field of
`BasisAnalyticPullbackBundle` only gives quotient-level descent
compatibility, yielding congruence modulo the period lattice — not
the exact covering-space equality required.

**Why a composition bundle does not resolve it.** Same cross-instance
opacity issue as `pushforwardTraceLift_comp_spec_apply_at`: a comp
bundle cannot constrain the per-`(f, hf)` opaques, since
`basisDualPullback f hf` is defined directly from
`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle f hf`.

**Mathlib API required to land this:** concrete pullback of
holomorphic 1-forms `f* : H⁰(Y, Ω¹) → H⁰(X, Ω¹)`, contravariant
functoriality `(g ∘ f)* = f* ∘ g*`, basis-coordinate matrix
representation. All absent in v4.28.0.

**Structural change required:** replace the per-`(f, hf)` opaque
bundle with a concrete (non-opaque) definition built from
`pullbackFormsMap`. This is the exact dual of the blocker on
`pushforwardTraceLift_comp_spec_apply_at`.

#### Bundle-primitive split (mirrors PushforwardBasis pattern)

The composition obligation is now isolated as a single
`AddMonoidHom`-equality at the bundle field level
(`basisAnalyticPullbackBundle_comp_dualPullback` below), with the
top-level `basisDualPullback_comp_top` and the per-vector
`basisDualPullback_comp` as sorry-free assemblies. This matches the
PushforwardBasis pattern (`basisAnalyticPushforwardBundle_comp_traceLift`
+ `pushforwardTraceLift_comp` + `_comp_spec_apply_at`). -/
