# Analytic pullback on the basis-aligned carrier

The basis-aligned analytic Jacobian `BasisAnalyticJacobian X` (defined in
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AnalyticOfCurveBasis.lean`) is a complex torus
quotient. A holomorphic map `f : X → Y` of compact Riemann surfaces
induces a pullback `f* : BasisAnalyticJacobian Y → BasisAnalyticJacobian X`
through the dual of the form pullback, descended through the period
quotient.

This module exposes the pullback as a small set of named obligations
that the top-down refinement of `Solution.pullback` (and its
functoriality lemmas) delegates to. Following the project's preference
for *small* named obligations:

* `analyticPullback f hf` — the pullback as a continuous additive
  homomorphism on the basis-aligned carrier (data, `opaque`);
* `analyticPullback_id` — pullback along the identity map is the
  identity (named sorry);
* `analyticPullback_comp` — pullback distributes over composition,
  contravariantly (named sorry);
* `analyticPullback_contMDiff` — the pullback is holomorphic (named
  sorry).

Bottom-up content: each is the descent through periods of the
corresponding identity on `(Fin g_Y → ℂ) →L[ℂ] (Fin g_X → ℂ)` linear
maps (the dual of holomorphic-form pullback in basis coordinates).

/-- Bundle carrying the analytic pullback together with its
covering-space representative `basisDualPullback` and the descent
compatibility axiom `mk_eq`.

The `analyticPullback` field is the bundled `→ₜ+` hom on the
basis-aligned carrier; the `basisDualPullback` field is the additive
hom on the covering space; `mk_eq` is the defining property linking
the two: `analyticPullback (mk v) = mk (basisDualPullback v)`.

Bottom-up: concretising `basisDualPullback` requires the dual of the
basis-aligned form-pullback; `analyticPullback` is then its descent
through the period quotient (using period-preservation), and `mk_eq`
is automatic from the descent. -/

/-! ### Deeper companions for contravariant functoriality

The opaque `analyticPullback` is the descent through the period
quotient of a linear map on the covering space — the dual of the
basis-aligned form-pullback. The two specs below capture that
relationship:

* `basisDualPullback` — the additive group homomorphism on the
  covering space (opaque data);
* `analyticPullback_mk_eq` — descent compatibility (sorry);
* `basisDualPullback_comp` — form-pullback contravariance (sorry).

**Proof.** Assembly from the deeper companions `analyticPullback_mk_eq`

`⟦v⟧` for some covering-space vector `v`; rewrite both sides using
descent compatibility, then apply the covering-space composition law. -/
