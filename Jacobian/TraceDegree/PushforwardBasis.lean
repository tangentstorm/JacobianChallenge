# Analytic pushforward on the basis-aligned carrier

A holomorphic map `f : X → Y` of compact Riemann surfaces induces a
pushforward `f_* : BasisAnalyticJacobian X → BasisAnalyticJacobian Y`,
typically constructed via the trace map on holomorphic 1-forms (or, in
basis coordinates, the dual of the trace), descended through the
period quotient.

This module mirrors `Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean` in the
opposite direction. Named obligations:

* `analyticPushforward f hf` — bundled `→ₜ+` hom on the basis-aligned
  carrier (`opaque`);
* `analyticPushforward_id_apply` — covariant identity functoriality;
* `analyticPushforward_comp_apply` — covariant composition;
* `analyticPushforward_contMDiff` — holomorphicity.

## TOPDOWN refactor: trace-coordinate interface (round R)

Earlier rounds bundled `analyticPushforward`, `pushforwardTraceLift`,
their descent compatibility, and their geometric properties together
in `BasisAnalyticPushforwardBundle`, then exposed each via
`Classical.choice` from a zero-valued `Inhabited` witness. This made
the identity functoriality `pushforwardTraceLift id = id` *unprovable*
at the bundle layer (the zero witness can't satisfy it), and attempts
to enrich the bundle with an `HEq`-based identity-case field hit an
instance diamond after `subst Y = X` (see prior commit
`410ce72`/`PullbackBasis HEq leak`).

This refactor breaks the bundle apart:

1. A small, contravariant **trace-coordinate interface**
   `holomorphicTraceCoord f hf : (Fin g_Y → ℂ) →ₗ[ℂ] (Fin g_X → ℂ)`,
   opaque, with two named functoriality sorries
   (`holomorphicTraceCoord_id`, `holomorphicTraceCoord_comp`).
   These are the *Mathlib-level* trace/norm-on-holomorphic-1-forms
   obligations a future
   `Mathlib.Analysis.Complex.RiemannSurface.Trace` would discharge.

2. A **uniform**, sorry-free top-level
   `pushforwardTraceLift f hf : (Fin g_X → ℂ) →+ (Fin g_Y → ℂ)`
   defined as the matrix transpose of `holomorphicTraceCoord f hf`.
   Functoriality of `pushforwardTraceLift` then collapses to
   "transpose preserves id/comp (contravariantly)" plus the two
   `holomorphicTraceCoord_*` sorries.

3. **Three "raw" geometric sorries** carrying the genuinely geometric
   content the bundle used to bundle:

   * `pushforwardTraceLift_preserves_lattice_raw` — the trace lift
     sends the period subgroup of `X` into the period subgroup of `Y`
     (Riemann bilinear / period-lattice content);
   * `analyticPushforward_mk_spec_raw` — descent compatibility:
     `analyticPushforward (mk v) = mk (pushforwardTraceLift v)`
     (descent of the trace map through the period quotient);
   * `analyticPushforward_contMDiff_raw` — the descended map is
     holomorphic (Mathlib quotient-smoothness content).

The original bundle and its `_id_traceLift` / `_comp_traceLift`
sorries are gone; the existing public API
(`analyticPushforward`, `pushforwardTraceLift`,
`analyticPushforward_id_apply`, etc.) keeps the same names and
signatures but is now wired through the new primitives. The two
"payoff" theorems `basisAnalyticPushforwardBundle_id_traceLift` and
`basisAnalyticPushforwardBundle_comp_traceLift` are kept as
sorry-free aliases (renamed `pushforwardTraceLift_eq_id` etc. would
be cleaner; the old names are kept here so the docstrings in
`PullbackBasis.lean` that name them remain accurate).

/-! ### Trace-coordinate interface

The fundamental small interface this module exposes. A holomorphic
map `f : X → Y` of compact Riemann surfaces should induce a
`ℂ`-linear *pullback on holomorphic 1-forms*
`f^* : H⁰(Y, Ω¹) → H⁰(X, Ω¹)`. After choosing bases of
`HolomorphicOneForm ℂ Y` and `HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X` (of dimensions
`analyticGenus ℂ Y` and `analyticGenus ℂ X` respectively), this is a
linear map of basis-coordinate vector spaces. We expose it as the
opaque `holomorphicTraceCoord` interface together with two named
functoriality sorries that match the Mathlib-style functoriality of
the form-pullback.
-/

/-- The basis-coordinate representation of the holomorphic-1-form
*pullback* induced by `f : X → Y`, as a ℂ-linear map
`(Fin g_Y → ℂ) →ₗ[ℂ] (Fin g_X → ℂ)`.

This is the **contravariant** direction (forms pull back along `f`),
which is why the codomain is `Fin g_X → ℂ` and the domain is
`Fin g_Y → ℂ`. The covariant pushforward
`pushforwardTraceLift f hf : (Fin g_X → ℂ) →+ (Fin g_Y → ℂ)`
is defined below as the matrix transpose of this map.

Bottom-up: built concretely from `pullbackFormsBundledLM` (the smooth
bundle of the chain-rule pullback), composed with the basis-aligned
linear equivalences `holomorphicOneFormFinBasis.equivFun` to convert
between abstract forms and `Fin g → ℂ` coordinates.

Functoriality (`holomorphicTraceCoord_id`, `holomorphicTraceCoord_comp`)
reduces to the corresponding `pullbackFormsBundledLM` functoriality
(`pullbackFormsBundledLM_id`, `pullbackFormsBundledLM_comp`), both of
which are sorry-free in `Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/PullbackBundled.lean`. -/

The descended map `analyticPushforward` lives on the period quotient

piece of geometric content (lattice preservation, descent
compatibility, smoothness of the descent).

Sorry: the algebraic relationship "matrix-transpose-of-coordinate-form

probably `LinearMap.dualMap_eq_transpose` or similar; here we expose it
as a single named obligation. -/
