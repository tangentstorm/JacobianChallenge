# Universe-polymorphic pullback trace-lift maps

`Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean` builds the analytic pullback
`analyticPullback f hf : BasisAnalyticJacobian Y →ₜ+ BasisAnalyticJacobian X`
from the trace-forms coordinate map `traceFormsCoord` and the dual-pullback
trace-lift `traceDualPullbackLift` (the transpose of `traceFormsCoord`), at
universe 0.

This file provides the universe-polymorphic companions `traceFormsCoordU` /
`traceDualPullbackLiftU` / `traceDualPullbackLiftLinearMapU` /
`traceDualPullbackLiftCLMU` (E2a of the TraceDegree "E-chain", pullback side —
the analogue of E0 on the pushforward side). They are the foundation on which the
universe-`u` `analyticPullbackU` (E2-core) — and hence the public `pullback` for
`X : Type u` (Milestone C) — will be built.

These maps are GENUINE (no sorry): the underlying `traceFormsBundledLM` has been
generalized to `Type*` in `Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/TraceSpec.lean` (a clean
binder-widen of its variable block, performed AFTER jc3's R-build merged, since
the deep dependencies `BranchedCoverData` /
`branchedCoverData_of_nonconstant_holomorphic` were already universe-polymorphic;
the widen was verified to leave jc3's R-leaves building unchanged). The matrix /
linear-map machinery (`holomorphicOneFormFinBasis.equivFun`, `Matrix.toLin'`,
transpose) is universe-polymorphic. Every declaration is a verbatim mirror of its
Type-0 original (`traceFormsCoord` / `traceDualPullbackLift*` in
`PullbackBasis.lean`).
