# Universe-polymorphic analytic-pullback smoothness

`Jacobian/TraceDegree/PullbackBasis.lean` proves the holomorphicity of the Type-0
analytic pullback (`analyticPullback_contMDiff_raw`, line 440) by a chart-based
`ContMDiffOn` argument: on each chart source, `analyticPullback` agrees with
`mk ∘ traceDualPullbackLiftCLM ∘ chart`, which is smooth as a composition of the
smooth chart map, the (continuous-linear, hence smooth) dual-pullback trace lift,
and the smooth quotient projection `mk`.

This file provides the universe-polymorphic companion `analyticPullback_contMDiffU`
(E2b of the TraceDegree "E-chain", pullback side), together with its
descent-compatibility prerequisite `analyticPullback_mk_spec_rawU`. It is the
holomorphicity half of `analyticPullbackU` (E2-core), needed by the public
`pullback_contMDiff` for `X : Type u` (Milestone C).

Both declarations are verbatim mirrors of their Type-0 originals (the same proof
as the pushforward side `analyticPushforward_contMDiff`, with the contravariant
`Y → X` direction and `traceDualPullbackLiftCLMU` in place of the pushforward
trace lift). The chart machinery is universe-polymorphic and the carriers
`Fin (analyticGenus ℂ X) → ℂ` are `Type 0`. Genuine — no sorry; the only `sorryAx`
dependence is transitive, through `periodFullComplexLatticeU`'s inherited Periods
layer-frontier obligations.

Descent compatibility: the universe-`u` analytic pullback of a quotient
representative `mk v` is the quotient of the dual-pullback-trace-lifted vector.
Universe-polymorphic companion to the Type-0 descent identity used in
`analyticPullback_contMDiff_raw`; holds by `rfl`.
