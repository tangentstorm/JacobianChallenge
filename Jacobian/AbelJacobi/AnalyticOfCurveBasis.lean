# Analytic Abel-Jacobi map (basis-aligned carrier)

This module provides the Abel-Jacobi map valued in the basis-aligned
analytic carrier, the same carrier used by `Jacobian/Solution.lean` for
`Jacobian X`. The named obligations here are what the top-down
`Solution.ofCurve` family delegates to.

The construction mirrors the witness algebra in
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/Defs.lean` (`witnessAbelJacobi`), but stays on the
basis-aligned model `Fin (analyticGenus ℂ X) → ℂ` rather than the
algebraic dual `(HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ)`. A future bridge
step can identify the two; until then this carrier is the one Solution
talks about.

Following the project's preference for *small* named obligations:

* `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q` — the path-integral coordinates (data,
  `opaque`);
* `pathIntegralFunctional_self` — base-point integral vanishes;
* `analyticOfCurve P` — the Abel-Jacobi map (assembly, no own sorry);
* `analyticOfCurve_self` — base-point sends to zero (assembly);
* `analyticOfCurve_contMDiff` — holomorphicity (named sorry);
* `analyticOfCurve_injective` — Abel injectivity for positive genus
  (named sorry).

/- Abel's theorem content: if two path-integral coordinate vectors
differ by a period vector, then their endpoints are equal.

This is the core mathematical content (bottom-up obligation).
The proof requires divisor theory / Riemann-Roch on compact Riemann
surfaces, which is not yet available in Mathlib.

#### TOPDOWN plan (planned split, not yet executed)

Classical proof outline (Forster / Farkas-Kra / Griffiths-Harris):

* By contradiction, assume `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` while
  `J(Q₁) = J(Q₂)` in `Jac(X)` (which is what `hperiod` encodes).
* Then the divisor `Q₁ - Q₂ ∈ Div⁰(X)` is non-zero with zero
  Abel-Jacobi image.
* **Abel's theorem (existence)** — divisors with zero Abel-Jacobi
  image are principal: there exists a meromorphic `f : X → ℂP¹`
  with `div(f) = Q₁ - Q₂`.
* Such `f` has exactly one simple zero (at `Q₁`) and one simple pole
  (at `Q₂`), so `deg(f) = 1`.
* **Riemann-Hurwitz** — a degree-1 holomorphic surjection `f : X → ℂP¹`
  forces `X ≅ ℂP¹` and therefore `genus X = 0`.
* Contradicts the hypothesis `0 < analyticGenus ℂ X`.

Decomposition into named sub-obligations:

1. **`abelJacobi_image_zero_implies_principal`** (NEW sorry, Abel's
   theorem existence direction): if `J(Q₁ - Q₂) = 0` then `Q₁ - Q₂`
   is principal — there exists meromorphic `f` with `div(f) = Q₁ - Q₂`.
   Mathlib gap: no divisor theory on compact Riemann surfaces, no
   formal `Div⁰(X)` / `Pic⁰(X)` / Abel-Jacobi map at the divisor
   level. (~5,000+ lines of upstream work.)

2. **`degree_one_meromorphic_implies_genus_zero`** (NEW sorry,
   Riemann-Hurwitz at degree 1): if there is a non-constant
   meromorphic `f : X → ℂP¹` of degree 1 (one simple zero, one simple
   pole), then `genus X = 0`. Mathlib gap: no Riemann-Hurwitz formula,
   no degree theory for branched coverings. (~3,000+ lines.)

3. **`pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points_spec`** (sorry-free
   assembly): from (1) and the principal-divisor witness, derive
   `f` of degree 1; from (2), conclude `genus X = 0`, contradicting
   `0 < analyticGenus ℂ X`. The translation between `analyticGenus`
   (analytic/Hodge) and topological/Riemann-Hurwitz genus uses the
   already-stated `analyticGenus_eq_topologicalGenus`
   (in `PeriodFunctional.lean`, also a sorry).

Net effect of the split: 1 deep sorry → 2 substantive named sub-
obligations + 1 sorry-free assembly. Worth executing once the divisor
theory layer or even a placeholder `Divisor X` / `IsPrincipal d` API
exists in the project. The docstring already captures the canonical
proof so future Aristotle/sub-agent jobs can split rather than
rediscover the structure. -/
/-! Combined Abel–Riemann-Hurwitz content (TOPDOWN-split via Aristotle 7ceff781):
if two distinct points have period-congruent path integrals, then
`analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`.

This condenses the two-step decomposition documented above
(`abelJacobi_image_zero_implies_principal` +
`degree_one_meromorphic_implies_genus_zero`) into one named obligation,
avoiding the need for intermediate types (`Divisor`, `ℂP¹`, `degree`) that
are absent from Mathlib v4.28.0.

#### Proof sketch (classical)

Assume `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` with `J(Q₁) = J(Q₂)` in `Jac(X)`. Then the divisor
`(Q₁) − (Q₂)` has zero Abel-Jacobi image and is therefore principal
(Abel's theorem, existence direction). A principal divisor of degree 0
with support `{Q₁, Q₂}` and multiplicities `+1, −1` gives a meromorphic
function `f : X → ℂP¹` of degree 1. By Riemann-Hurwitz, a degree-1
holomorphic map to `ℂP¹` forces `X ≅ ℂP¹`, hence `genus(X) = 0`.

#### Mathlib gaps

- Divisor theory on compact Riemann surfaces (≈5 000 lines)
- Riemann-Hurwitz formula / degree theory (≈3 000 lines)
- Bridge `analyticGenus ↔ topologicalGenus` (Hodge/de Rham, delegated to
  `analyticGenus_eq_topologicalGenus` in `PeriodFunctional.lean`) -/
/-! ### Round 1 (2026-05-05) — implement the documented top-down split

The single sorry `period_congruence_distinct_implies_genus_zero` is
split into the two named obligations the file's docstring already
proposed (lines 187–232 above) plus a sorry-free assembly:

* `abelJacobi_image_zero_implies_principal` — Abel's theorem
  (existence direction): from period congruence with `Q₁ ≠ Q₂`, get a
  `MeromorphicMapToSphere X` whose principal divisor is
  `Divisor.point Q₁ - Divisor.point Q₂`.
* `degree_one_meromorphicMap_implies_analyticGenus_zero` — Riemann-
  Hurwitz at degree 1: from a `MeromorphicMapToSphere X` whose pole
  divisor is `Divisor.point Q₂` (i.e. one simple pole), conclude
  `analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`.

The assembly composes them: from period congruence get the
meromorphic map (Abel), normalise its pole divisor (it's
`-poleDivisor + zeroDivisor = principalDivisor`, with
`principalDivisor = (Q₁) - (Q₂)`, which forces `poleDivisor = (Q₂)`
up to a normalisation step recorded as a separate auxiliary), then
apply Riemann-Hurwitz at degree 1. -/

/-- **Stage A leaf (round 1).** Abel's theorem (existence direction)
in this project's basis-aligned formulation. From the hypothesis that
two distinct points `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` have period-congruent path integrals,
produce a meromorphic map `X → ℂ∞` whose principal divisor is
`(Q₁) - (Q₂)` and whose pole divisor is `(Q₂)`.

Bottom-up: classical Abel's theorem; Mathlib v4.28.0 lacks divisor
theory on Riemann surfaces, so this leaf is currently a sorry. -/

meromorphic map `X → ℂ∞` with pole divisor a single point gives a

Bottom-up: the existing `meromorphicDegreeOneData_of_poleDivisor_point`
companion (in `MeromorphicDegree.lean`) plus a still-missing transfer
from "X is in continuous bijection with ℂ∞" to `analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`. -/

/-- Abel injectivity for positive genus.

Top-down obligation. Bottom-up: Abel's theorem — for `0 < g`, the
analytic Abel-Jacobi map separates points. Requires point-separation
by holomorphic 1-forms.

### Blocker analysis for `analyticOfCurve_injective`

**Goal.** Show `Function.Injective (analyticOfCurve X P)` where
`analyticOfCurve X P : X → BasisAnalyticJacobian X` sends each
point `Q` to the class
`mk (Fin g → ℂ) (periodFullComplexLattice X) (pathIntegralFunctional X P Q)`
in the period quotient `(Fin g → ℂ) ⧸ basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X`,
and `g = analyticGenus ℂ X ≥ 1`.

Injectivity of this map is the *point-separation* case of **Abel's
theorem**: if `analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂` then
`Q₁ = Q₂`. Equivalently, the degree-1 Abel-Jacobi map
`Q ↦ [Q − P] ∈ Pic⁰(X)` is injective on points of `X`.

#### Mathematical proof routes

**Route (A): Riemann-Roch.** Suppose `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` but
`analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂`. Then the divisor
`(Q₁) − (Q₂)` is principal, i.e. there exists a meromorphic function
`f : X → ℂ∞` with `div(f) = (Q₁) − (Q₂)`. Such `f` has a single
simple pole at `Q₂` and a single simple zero at `Q₁`, hence `f` gives
a holomorphic map `X → ℂℙ¹` of degree 1, i.e. a biholomorphism
`X ≅ ℂℙ¹`. But `ℂℙ¹` has genus 0, contradicting `g ≥ 1`.

This is the most elementary route, but it requires:
- Meromorphic functions on compact Riemann surfaces (absent from Mathlib);
- The notion of degree of a meromorphic function / holomorphic map;
- The fact that degree-1 holomorphic maps are biholomorphisms;
- That `ℂℙ¹` has genus 0 (`analyticGenus ℂ (ℂℙ¹) = 0`).

**Route (B): Direct 1-form separation.** Unwind the quotient:
`analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂` means
`pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₁ − pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₂ ∈ basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X`.
Since `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q = (∫_P^Q ω₁, …, ∫_P^Q ωₘ)` in
basis coordinates, this says `(∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ωⱼ)ⱼ` is a period vector.
Abel's theorem then asserts that this forces `Q₁ = Q₂` (for `g ≥ 1`).
The essential content is that holomorphic 1-forms separate points
modulo periods, which again reduces to the non-existence of
degree-1 meromorphic functions.

**Route (C): Theta function.** The Riemann theta function approach
shows that the Abel-Jacobi image of the symmetric product
`Sym^{g-1}(X)` is exactly the theta divisor `Θ ⊂ J(X)`. For `g ≥ 1`,
the degree-1 Abel-Jacobi map `X → J(X)` is an embedding because its
fibres are connected components of `Θ ∩ (Θ + c)` for a translate,
which for generic `c` are singletons. This is the most powerful but
also the most infrastructure-heavy route.

#### Project-internal dependency analysis

1. **`pathIntegralFunctional` is `opaque` with no equations.**
   The only available property is `pathIntegralFunctional_self`
   (base-point integral vanishes, itself `sorry`). No linearity,
   no additivity in paths, no relationship to holomorphic 1-forms.
   Any proof of injectivity needs at minimum an opaque property
   encoding the Abel-theorem content.

2. **`analyticOfCurve` is *not* a group homomorphism.** It is a bare
   function `X → BasisAnalyticJacobian X`, not a `MonoidHom` or
   `AddMonoidHom`. So `MonoidHom.ker_eq_bot_iff` does not directly
   apply. Injectivity must be proved directly as
   `∀ Q₁ Q₂, analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂ → Q₁ = Q₂`.

3. **`analyticGenus ℂ X ≥ 1` is a hypothesis but has limited API.**
   `analyticGenus_pos_iff_nontrivial` (in
   `Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/AnalyticGenusPos.lean`) equates
   `0 < analyticGenus ℂ X` with `Nontrivial (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X)`.
   This gives the existence of a non-zero holomorphic 1-form but not
   point-separation.

4. **No meromorphic function theory in the project.** There is no
   `MeromorphicOn` for manifold-valued functions, no divisor type,
   no degree theory for holomorphic maps between Riemann surfaces.

5. **`BasisAnalyticJacobian X` quotient injectivity.** By
   `mk_injective_iff_subgroup_eq_bot`, the quotient map
   `mk : (Fin g → ℂ) → BasisAnalyticJacobian X` is injective iff
   `basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X = ⊥`. For `g ≥ 1` this is false
   (the period lattice is non-trivial), so injectivity of
   `analyticOfCurve` does *not* reduce to injectivity of `mk`. The
   key content is that `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₁` and
   `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₂` can only differ by a period
   vector when `Q₁ = Q₂`.

#### Blocker breakdown

| # | Blocker | Severity | Location |
|---|---------|----------|----------|
| 1 | **No Abel-theorem content on `pathIntegralFunctional`.** The `opaque` has no property encoding that distinct points yield non-congruent integrals. | Critical | `Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AnalyticOfCurveBasis.lean` |
| 2 | **No meromorphic function / divisor theory.** Route (A) requires `MeromorphicOn` for manifolds, principal divisors, and degree of holomorphic maps — all absent from Mathlib v4.28.0 and the project. | Critical (if pursuing Route A) | Mathlib gap |
| 3 | **No holomorphic 1-form point-separation.** Route (B) requires showing that if `∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω = 0` for all holomorphic 1-forms `ω` then `Q₁ = Q₂` — a deep analytic fact not available. | Critical (if pursuing Route B) | Mathlib gap + project gap |
| 4 | **No multi-variable theta function.** Route (C) requires the Riemann theta function `Θ : ℂᵍ → ℂ`, its zero locus, and the Riemann vanishing theorem — all absent. | Critical (if pursuing Route C) | Mathlib gap |
| 5 | **`pathIntegralFunctional_self` is `sorry`.** Even the base-point property is unproved, though this is not directly needed for injectivity. | Minor | This file |

#### Recommended resolution path

The most economical resolution is to **declare a new `opaque` property
capturing the Abel-theorem injectivity content** alongside
`pathIntegralFunctional` (or in this file), then wire
`analyticOfCurve_injective` as a one-liner assembly.

**Step 1.** Declare in this file (or in a new
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AbelTheoremAux.lean`):
```lean
opaque pathIntegralFunctional_injective_mod_periods
    (X : Type) [TopologicalSpace X] [T2Space X] [CompactSpace X]
    [ConnectedSpace X] [ChartedSpace ℂ X]
    [IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞) X]
    (P : X) (h : 0 < analyticGenus ℂ X) :
    Function.Injective (analyticOfCurve X P)
```
or, more structurally (separating the mathematical content from the
assembly):
```lean
opaque pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points
    (X : Type) [...] (P : X) (h : 0 < analyticGenus ℂ X)
    (Q₁ Q₂ : X)
    (heq : pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₁ - pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₂
           ∈ basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X) :
    Q₁ = Q₂
```
The second form is preferable because it isolates the Abel-theorem
content ("period-congruent integrals imply equal points") from the
quotient-assembly layer.

**Step 2.** Wire `analyticOfCurve_injective`:
```lean
lemma analyticOfCurve_injective (P : X) (h : 0 < analyticGenus ℂ X) :
    Function.Injective (analyticOfCurve X P) := by
  intro Q₁ Q₂ heq
  apply pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points X P h Q₁ Q₂
  exact QuotientAddGroup.eq.mp heq
```
This collapses the top-down obligation to the named bottom-up
obligation `pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points`.

**Step 3 (future bottom-up).** Discharge
`pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points` via one of:
- A formalised Riemann-Roch argument (requires extensive new Mathlib
  infrastructure: meromorphic functions on manifolds, divisors, degree
  theory, genus-0 classification);
- A direct 1-form separation argument (requires integration theory on
  manifolds, homotopy invariance of integrals, and the classical
  result that holomorphic 1-forms separate points modulo periods on
  compact Riemann surfaces of positive genus);
- `MDifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compactSpace` as the key
  Mathlib ingredient: if a degree-1 meromorphic function existed, it
  would give a non-constant holomorphic function on a compact
  connected manifold, contradicting this lemma. But bridging from
  "period-congruent integrals" to "existence of degree-1 meromorphic
  function" still requires divisor theory not in Mathlib.

#### Anti-hack chain position

This is one of the **four anti-hack obligations** in the Jacobian
challenge. The chain is:
```
Solution.ofCurve_injective
  └─► analyticOfCurve_injective  [this lemma]
        └─► pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points  [proposed]
              └─► Abel's theorem (deep bottom-up content)
```
The sorry here is load-bearing: it cannot be discharged by assembly
alone. Any legitimate resolution requires either (a) a new opaque
capturing the Abel-theorem content as described above, or (b) a full
bottom-up formalisation of Abel's theorem — which in turn requires
substantial new Mathlib infrastructure (meromorphic functions on
manifolds, divisor theory, degree of maps between Riemann surfaces).
