# Analytic Abel-Jacobi map (basis-aligned carrier)

This module provides the Abel-Jacobi map valued in the basis-aligned
analytic carrier, the same carrier used by `Jacobian/Solution.lean` for
`Jacobian X`. The named obligations here are what the top-down
`Solution.ofCurve` family delegates to.

The construction mirrors the witness algebra in
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/Defs.lean` (`witnessAbelJacobi`), but stays on the
basis-aligned model `Fin (analyticGenus ℂ X) → ℂ` rather than the
algebraic dual `(HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ)`. A future bridge
step can identify the two; until then this carrier is the one Solution
talks about.

Following the project's preference for *small* named obligations:

Bundle carrying the path-integral functional together with its

The `val` field is the function `X → X → Fin g → ℂ` that maps
`(P, Q)` to the vector of integrals `(∫_P^Q ω₁, …, ∫_P^Q ωₘ)`
in basis coordinates.

The `self_spec` field captures the axiom that integrating over a
constant loop (from `P` to `P`) yields zero.

Bottom-up: concretising `val` requires multi-chart path integration
plus a basis choice; `self_spec` then follows from the fact that the
integral over a constant path is trivially zero.

Combined Abel–Riemann-Hurwitz content (TOPDOWN-split via Aristotle 7ceff781):
if two distinct points have period-congruent path integrals, then
`analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`.

This condenses the two-step decomposition documented above
(`abelJacobi_image_zero_implies_principal` +
`degree_one_meromorphic_implies_genus_zero`) into one named obligation,
avoiding the need for intermediate types (`Divisor`, `ℂP¹`, `degree`) that
are absent from Mathlib v4.28.0.

#### Proof sketch (classical)

Assume `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` with `J(Q₁) = J(Q₂)` in `Jac(X)`. Then the divisor
`(Q₁) − (Q₂)` has zero Abel-Jacobi image and is therefore principal
(Abel's theorem, existence direction). A principal divisor of degree 0
with support `{Q₁, Q₂}` and multiplicities `+1, −1` gives a meromorphic
function `f : X → ℂP¹` of degree 1. By Riemann-Hurwitz, a degree-1
holomorphic map to `ℂP¹` forces `X ≅ ℂP¹`, hence `genus(X) = 0`.

#### Mathlib gaps

* `abelJacobi_image_zero_implies_principal` — Abel's theorem
  (existence direction): from period congruence with `Q₁ ≠ Q₂`, get a
  `MeromorphicMapToSphere X` whose principal divisor is
  `Divisor.point Q₁ - Divisor.point Q₂`.
* `degree_one_meromorphicMap_implies_analyticGenus_zero` — Riemann-
  Hurwitz at degree 1: from a `MeromorphicMapToSphere X` whose pole
  divisor is `Divisor.point Q₂` (i.e. one simple pole), conclude
  `analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`.

The assembly composes them: from period congruence get the
meromorphic map (Abel), normalise its pole divisor (it's
`-poleDivisor + zeroDivisor = principalDivisor`, with
`principalDivisor = (Q₁) - (Q₂)`, which forces `poleDivisor = (Q₂)`
up to a normalisation step recorded as a separate auxiliary), then
apply Riemann-Hurwitz at degree 1.

Given a base point `P`, two distinct endpoints `Q₁ ≠ Q₂`, and the
hypothesis that the path-integral coordinate vectors at `Q₁` and `Q₂`
differ by an element of the basis-aligned period subgroup (i.e. the
analytic Abel-Jacobi class of the divisor `(Q₁) - (Q₂)` is zero in the
basis-aligned analytic Jacobian), produce a meromorphic map
`f : X → OnePoint ℂ` whose pole divisor is exactly the single point
`(Q₂)` (and, packaged together, whose zero divisor is `(Q₁)` and whose
principal divisor is `(Q₁) - (Q₂)`).

#### Mathematical content (Abel's theorem, existence direction)

This is the existence half of the classical Abel theorem
(Forster, *Lectures on Riemann Surfaces*, Thm 21.7; Farkas–Kra, *Riemann
Surfaces*, III.6.3). For every degree-zero divisor `D` on a compact
Riemann surface `X` of genus `g ≥ 1`,
```
   AJ(D) = 0 in Jac(X)  ⇒  D is principal,
```
i.e. `D = (f)` for some non-zero meromorphic function `f`. The classical
proof either:

* (theta-function route) constructs `f` via
  `f(p) := θ(AJ([p] - [p₀]) - e)` for a suitable vector `e` depending
  on `D`, then verifies `(f) = D` using the Riemann vanishing theorem
  for `θ`; or
* (period-lattice route) cuts `X` along a symplectic homology basis to
  obtain a fundamental polygon, defines a multivalued logarithmic
  primitive, exponentiates, and checks well-definedness from
  `AJ(D) = 0` (the period lattice obstruction vanishes).

In both routes the function constructed has prescribed simple zero at
`Q₁` and prescribed simple pole at `Q₂` (and no others) when
`D = (Q₁) - (Q₂)`.

Auxiliary structure: a "raw" meromorphic function on `X` together
with its principal divisor, packaged as a sigma-type so we can refer
to it abstractly without committing to a concrete representation
class.

The carrier `meromorphicMap : MeromorphicMapToSphere X` is reused
because it is the only meromorphic-function-on-manifold type the
project currently has; the `principalDivisor_eq` field re-exposes the
`MeromorphicMapToSphere`'s `principalDivisor_eq` axiom.

This is a *bridge* type only — it lets us state the Abel sub-leaf
without asking the bottom-up Abel proof to also prove the
`zeros / poles` decomposition (that is recorded as a separate
sub-leaf).

A genuine third-kind differential is a meromorphic 1-form `ω` with
simple poles at `Q₁` (residue `+1`) and `Q₂` (residue `-1`) and no
other poles. Since the project does not yet have a global
`MeromorphicOneForm X` type, we record the corresponding data on the
function side: a `RawMeromorphicWithPrincipal` whose underlying
function has its pole divisor concentrated at `(Q₁) + (Q₂)`. The
analytic equivalence between "third-kind 1-form" and "meromorphic
function with two simple poles" comes from `f ↦ d log f = df / f`
(direction one) and integration of `ω` against any meromorphic
function with the right divisor (direction two).

The `ord` field is intentionally absent: the project's
`MeromorphicMapToSphere` carries no link to `MeromorphicAt.order`, so
"residue ±1" is an invariant the bundle does not yet expose.

Mathematically: the multivalued logarithm `log f` of the third-kind
function (or, equivalently, the integral `∫ d log f` along any cycle)
has periods. The vanishing hypothesis says the period vector lies in

`AJ((Q₁) - (Q₂)) = 0` in `Jac(X)` (Riemann reciprocity).

**R5/A:** For any two distinct points `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` on a compact Riemann
surface, there exists a meromorphic function `X → ℂ∞` whose pole
divisor is exactly `(Q₁) + (Q₂)`. This is the function-side analogue
of the classical "differentials of the third kind" existence statement
(Forster §17.10 / §18.1). The classical statement is:

> For any finite set of points `{P_i}` and complex numbers `{a_i}`
> with `∑ a_i = 0`, there exists a meromorphic 1-form on `X` with
> simple poles at the `P_i` of residue `a_i`.

The function-side analogue follows from Riemann-Roch applied to the
divisor `(Q₁) + (Q₂)`: `ℓ((Q₁) + (Q₂)) ≥ 3 − g`, plus the trivial
bound `ℓ ≥ 1` for any effective divisor.

### R6/A1 retained docstring

The Riemann-Roch theorem on a compact Riemann surface of genus `g`
gives `ℓ(D) − ℓ(K − D) = d − g + 1` for a divisor `D` of degree `d`.
For `D = (Q₁) + (Q₂)` (d = 2), the formula reads
`ℓ((Q₁) + (Q₂)) − ℓ(K − D) = 3 − g`. Combining with `ℓ(K − D) ≥ 0`
and `ℓ(D) ≥ 1` (constants), one obtains `ℓ((Q₁) + (Q₂)) ≥ 2`. The
genus-by-genus case analysis is left to `dim_geq_two_from_RR_formula`.

#### Mathematical content

The general Riemann-Roch theorem on a compact Riemann surface `X` of
genus `g` states that for any divisor `D` of degree `d`,
```
   ℓ(D) − ℓ(K − D) = d − g + 1,
```
where `ℓ(D) := dim H⁰(X, 𝒪(D))` is the Riemann-Roch space dimension
and `K` is a canonical divisor. Applied to `D = (Q₁) + (Q₂)` with
`d = 2`, this yields
```
   ℓ((Q₁) + (Q₂)) = ℓ(K − (Q₁) − (Q₂)) + 3 − g.
```

This sub-leaf records the bare specialisation; it does not yet
assert that `ℓ(K − D) ≥ 0` (which is automatic) or compute the final
lower bound (handled in the next sub-leaf).

#### Mathematical content

For any divisor `D` of degree `d` on a compact Riemann surface `X`
of genus `g`, the dimensions `ℓ(D) := dim H⁰(X, 𝒪(D))` and
`ℓ(K − D) := dim H⁰(X, Ω¹(−D))` satisfy
```
   ℓ(D) − ℓ(K − D) = d − g + 1.
```

This is *the* classical Riemann-Roch theorem for compact Riemann
surfaces. See `Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/RiemannRochStrong.lean` for
a related sheaf-cohomology formulation
(`riemann_roch_strong_h0` for the high-degree special case).

correspondence `D ↦ 𝒪(D)`, which is a separate piece of
infrastructure not yet in the project.

  `2g − 2 − 2 = 2`, and for generic two-point `D`, `ℓ(K − D) ≥ 1`
  iff `D` is in the canonical image of `Sym²(X) → Pic²(X)`, which
  has codimension ≥ 1 (Brill-Noether for `g = 2`).
* For `g ≥ 3`: similar Brill-Noether argument gives generic non-
  speciality of two-point divisors, so `ℓ(K − D) = 0` generically
  and `ℓ(D) = 3 − g + 0`; we need a different argument for the
  `≥ 2` bound (uses Mittag-Leffler / cohomology vanishing).

The classical content: the Riemann-Roch space `L((Q₁) + (Q₂))` of
dimension `≥ 2` modulo constants has dimension `≥ 1`; pick any non-
constant element. For `g ≥ 1`, no function with a single simple pole
exists (else genus zero), so the pole divisor is automatically the
full `(Q₁) + (Q₂)`.

#### Mathematical content

A `ℂ`-vector space `V` of dimension `≥ 2` modulo a 1-dimensional
subspace `W` (the constants) has dimension `≥ 1`, so there exists
`v ∈ V \ W`, i.e. a non-constant element. Specifically, the
Riemann-Roch space `L(D)` always contains the constant functions
(when `D` is effective, which `(Q₁) + (Q₂)` is); the dimension `≥ 2`
hypothesis then yields a non-constant element. The output is
packaged as a `RawMeromorphicWithPrincipal` whose `meromorphicMap`
has poles bounded by `(Q₁) + (Q₂)` (i.e. `f.poles ≤ (Q₁) + (Q₂)` in
the divisor partial order).
-/
/-!
This is the trivial observation that the constant function `1`
satisfies `(1) + D = D ≥ 0` for any effective `D`. The
`MemRiemannRochSpace` predicate just records the divisor-bound
condition.

#### Mathematical content

For `g ≥ 1`, no meromorphic function `X → ℂ∞` has a single simple
pole at one point and no other poles (this would be a degree-1 map
to `ℂℙ¹`, forcing `g = 0` by Riemann-Hurwitz; cf. S20). For `g = 0`,
explicit two-point constructions exist (`1/(z - Q₁) - 1/(z - Q₂)`
on `ℂℙ¹`). In either case, a non-constant element of
`L((Q₁) + (Q₂))` whose pole divisor is bounded by `(Q₁) + (Q₂)` can
be normalised so that its pole divisor equals exactly
`(Q₁) + (Q₂)` (not strictly smaller).

Concretely: if `f.poles ≤ (Q₁) + (Q₂)`, then `f.poles` is one of
`0, (Q₁), (Q₂), (Q₁) + (Q₂)`. The cases `0` (holomorphic) and
single-point are ruled out by Liouville and degree-1 considerations
respectively (for `g ≥ 1`). For genus 0, take a difference of
two single-pole functions to land in the two-point case.

**R5/B:** Given third-kind data `td : ThirdKindMeromorphicData X Q₁ Q₂`
and the period-congruence hypothesis encoding `AJ((Q₁) - (Q₂)) = 0`,
the "logarithmic period" of `td.data` vanishes (the period vector of
`d log f` lies in `2πi · ℤ^{2g}`). This is one of the Riemann
bilinear relations (Forster §20.4):

```
   ∑_j ( ∫_{a_j} ω · ∫_{b_j} ω_k − ∫_{b_j} ω · ∫_{a_j} ω_k )
     = 2πi · ( ∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k )
```

The "twisted period" of `ω = d log f` against any holomorphic 1-form
`ω_k` equals `2πi · ∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k`. Vanishing modulo the period
lattice on the right is exactly the AJ-kernel condition.

Unfold the basis-aligned hypothesis

this says the difference vector `(∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k)_k` lies in the
basis-aligned period lattice. So for each basis 1-form `ω_k`, the
path integral `∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k` is a `ℤ`-linear combination of
basis-aligned period vectors, in particular it lies in the period
lattice.

Multiplying each `∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k ∈ Λ` by `2πi` gives `2πi
∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k ∈ 2πi · Λ`. By the residue-pairing identity (R7/B1),
each twisted period of `d log f₀` equals `2πi · ∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ω_k`.
Combining: the twisted periods of `d log f₀` lie in `2πi · Λ`, which
is `LogPeriodVanishing` data.

This is essentially an arithmetic combination of two prior facts.

**R5/C:** From third-kind data plus log-period vanishing, produce a
single-valued meromorphic function on `X` whose principal divisor is
`(Q₁) − (Q₂)`. The classical exponentiation-of-logarithmic-primitive
construction (Forster §21.7, Farkas-Kra III.6.3) goes:

1. Let `ω = d log f` for `f` the third-kind function. By hypothesis
   the periods of `ω` lie in `2πi · ℤ^{2g}`.
2. Choose a base point `P` and define `g̃(p) := exp( ∫_P^p ω )`;
   single-valued because `exp(period) = 1`.
3. Local analysis at `Q₁, Q₂` (residues `±1`) gives a simple zero
   at `Q₁` and a simple pole at `Q₂`.
4. Therefore `(g̃) = (Q₁) − (Q₂)`.

**Mathlib v4.28.0 status:** ABSENT. No global log/exp construction on
Riemann surfaces; no multivalued holomorphic primitives; no
period-lattice quotient at the function level.

### R8/C1 retained docstring

A closed 1-form `ω` on a connected manifold has a multivalued
primitive whose monodromy is the period subgroup. When the period
subgroup is `2πi · ℤ^{2g}`, we get a `ℂ/2πi·ℤ`-valued single-valued
function. This is two pieces of de Rham theory: closedness of
`d log f₀` (since `f₀` is meromorphic and the log derivative of a
meromorphic function is automatically closed off its zero/pole
locus), and the universal-covering / period-quotient construction
of the primitive.

#### Mathematical content

Let `ω` be a closed 1-form on a connected manifold `M`, with period
subgroup `Per(ω) ⊆ ℂ`. Then `ω` admits a primitive `F : M → ℂ/Per(ω)`,
single-valued by construction: pick a base point `p₀`, define
`F(p) := ∫_{p₀}^p ω` along any path, and quotient by `Per(ω)` to
collapse the path-dependence ambiguity (which is exactly an element
of `Per(ω)`).

For our setup, `ω = d log f₀` on `X \ {Q₁, Q₂}` and
`Per(ω) ⊆ 2πi · ℤ^{2g}` by the log-period vanishing hypothesis. So
`F : X \ {Q₁, Q₂} → ℂ/(2πi · ℤ)` is well-defined and single-valued.

#### Mathematical content

The three local extension properties (holomorphic-and-non-vanishing
off punctures, simple zero at `Q₁`, simple pole at `Q₂`) glue into a
global meromorphic function `g̃ : X → ℂ∞` whose principal divisor is
exactly `(Q₁) - (Q₂)`. The packaging into
`RawMeromorphicWithPrincipal` is structural since the project's
`MeromorphicMapToSphere` carries no axioms binding `toMap` to its
divisor data.

Given a meromorphic data bundle `data : RawMeromorphicWithPrincipal X`
whose principal divisor is `(Q₁) - (Q₂)` with `Q₁ ≠ Q₂`, package the
underlying `data.meromorphicMap.toMap` into a fresh
`MeromorphicMapToSphere X` whose `zeroDivisor` is exactly `(Q₁)`,
whose `poleDivisor` is exactly `(Q₂)`, and which therefore satisfies
all of the structural axioms of `MeromorphicMapToSphere` against this
canonical divisor data.

Mathematically this is the classical fact that a meromorphic function
`f : X → ℂ̂` whose principal divisor is `(Q₁) - (Q₂)` has a *simple
zero* at `Q₁` and a *simple pole* at `Q₂` (and is finite-and-nonzero
elsewhere), so its canonical zero/pole decomposition is forced.
Formally, this requires reading the per-point analytic order off of
`data.meromorphicMap.toMap` — content the current
`RawMeromorphicWithPrincipal` interface does not expose, so the proof
remains a single named obligation here.

1. `meromorphicDegreeOneData_of_poleDivisor_point` (in
   `MeromorphicDegree.lean`) extracts continuity and bijectivity of
   `f.toMap` from the simple-pole hypothesis.
2. `Continuous.homeoOfEquivCompactToT2` (Mathlib) promotes a
   continuous bijection between a compact space and a T₂ space to a
   homeomorphism, giving `X ≃ₜ OnePoint ℂ`.
3. `onePointCx_homeomorph_sphere` (in `GenusZeroClassification.lean`)
   composes with the standard homeomorphism `OnePoint ℂ ≃ₜ S²` (via
   inverse stereographic projection / `onePointEquivSphereOfFinrankEq`
   from Mathlib).
4. `analyticGenus_eq_zero_of_homeomorphic_sphere` (in
   `GenusZeroClassification.lean`) concludes
   `analyticGenus ℂ X = 0`.

Abel injectivity for positive genus.

Top-down obligation. Bottom-up: Abel's theorem — for `0 < g`, the
analytic Abel-Jacobi map separates points. Requires point-separation
by holomorphic 1-forms.

**Goal.** Show `Function.Injective (analyticOfCurve X P)` where
`analyticOfCurve X P : X → BasisAnalyticJacobian X` sends each
point `Q` to the class
`mk (Fin g → ℂ) (periodFullComplexLattice X) (pathIntegralFunctional X P Q)`
in the period quotient `(Fin g → ℂ) ⧸ basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X`,
and `g = analyticGenus ℂ X ≥ 1`.

Injectivity of this map is the *point-separation* case of **Abel's
theorem**: if `analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂` then
`Q₁ = Q₂`. Equivalently, the degree-1 Abel-Jacobi map
`Q ↦ [Q − P] ∈ Pic⁰(X)` is injective on points of `X`.

#### Mathematical proof routes

**Route (A): Riemann-Roch.** Suppose `Q₁ ≠ Q₂` but
`analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂`. Then the divisor
`(Q₁) − (Q₂)` is principal, i.e. there exists a meromorphic function
`f : X → ℂ∞` with `div(f) = (Q₁) − (Q₂)`. Such `f` has a single
simple pole at `Q₂` and a single simple zero at `Q₁`, hence `f` gives
a holomorphic map `X → ℂℙ¹` of degree 1, i.e. a biholomorphism
`X ≅ ℂℙ¹`. But `ℂℙ¹` has genus 0, contradicting `g ≥ 1`.

This is the most elementary route, but it requires:
- Meromorphic functions on compact Riemann surfaces (absent from Mathlib);
- The notion of degree of a meromorphic function / holomorphic map;
- The fact that degree-1 holomorphic maps are biholomorphisms;
- That `ℂℙ¹` has genus 0 (`analyticGenus ℂ (ℂℙ¹) = 0`).

**Route (B): Direct 1-form separation.** Unwind the quotient:
`analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂` means
`pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₁ − pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₂ ∈ basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X`.
Since `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q = (∫_P^Q ω₁, …, ∫_P^Q ωₘ)` in
basis coordinates, this says `(∫_{Q₂}^{Q₁} ωⱼ)ⱼ` is a period vector.
Abel's theorem then asserts that this forces `Q₁ = Q₂` (for `g ≥ 1`).
The essential content is that holomorphic 1-forms separate points
modulo periods, which again reduces to the non-existence of
degree-1 meromorphic functions.

**Route (C): Theta function.** The Riemann theta function approach
shows that the Abel-Jacobi image of the symmetric product
`Sym^{g-1}(X)` is exactly the theta divisor `Θ ⊂ J(X)`. For `g ≥ 1`,
the degree-1 Abel-Jacobi map `X → J(X)` is an embedding because its
fibres are connected components of `Θ ∩ (Θ + c)` for a translate,
which for generic `c` are singletons. This is the most powerful but
also the most infrastructure-heavy route.

#### Project-internal dependency analysis

2. **`analyticOfCurve` is *not* a group homomorphism.** It is a bare
   function `X → BasisAnalyticJacobian X`, not a `MonoidHom` or
   `AddMonoidHom`. So `MonoidHom.ker_eq_bot_iff` does not directly
   apply. Injectivity must be proved directly as
   `∀ Q₁ Q₂, analyticOfCurve X P Q₁ = analyticOfCurve X P Q₂ → Q₁ = Q₂`.

3. **`analyticGenus ℂ X ≥ 1` is a hypothesis but has limited API.**
   `analyticGenus_pos_iff_nontrivial` (in
   `Jacobian/HolomorphicForms/AnalyticGenusPos.lean`) equates
   `0 < analyticGenus ℂ X` with `Nontrivial (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X)`.
   This gives the existence of a non-zero holomorphic 1-form but not
   point-separation.

4. **No meromorphic function theory in the project.** There is no
   `MeromorphicOn` for manifold-valued functions, no divisor type,
   no degree theory for holomorphic maps between Riemann surfaces.

5. **`BasisAnalyticJacobian X` quotient injectivity.** By
   `mk_injective_iff_subgroup_eq_bot`, the quotient map
   `mk : (Fin g → ℂ) → BasisAnalyticJacobian X` is injective iff
   `basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X = ⊥`. For `g ≥ 1` this is false
   (the period lattice is non-trivial), so injectivity of
   `analyticOfCurve` does *not* reduce to injectivity of `mk`. The
   key content is that `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₁` and
   `pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₂` can only differ by a period
   vector when `Q₁ = Q₂`.

#### Recommended resolution path

The most economical resolution is to **declare a new `opaque` property
capturing the Abel-theorem injectivity content** alongside
`pathIntegralFunctional` (or in this file), then wire
`analyticOfCurve_injective` as a one-liner assembly.

**Step 1.** Declare in this file (or in a new
`Jacobian/AbelJacobi/AbelTheoremAux.lean`):
```lean
opaque pathIntegralFunctional_injective_mod_periods
    (X : Type) [TopologicalSpace X] [T2Space X] [CompactSpace X]
    [ConnectedSpace X] [ChartedSpace ℂ X]
    [IsManifold (modelWithCornersSelf ℂ ℂ) (⊤ : WithTop ℕ∞) X]
    [JacobianChallenge.Periods.StableChartAt ℂ X]
    (P : X) (h : 0 < analyticGenus ℂ X) :
    Function.Injective (analyticOfCurve X P)
```
or, more structurally (separating the mathematical content from the
assembly):
```lean
opaque pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points
    (X : Type) [...] (P : X) (h : 0 < analyticGenus ℂ X)
    (Q₁ Q₂ : X)
    (heq : pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₁ - pathIntegralFunctional X P Q₂
           ∈ basisAlignedPeriodSubgroup X) :
    Q₁ = Q₂
```
The second form is preferable because it isolates the Abel-theorem
content ("period-congruent integrals imply equal points") from the
quotient-assembly layer.

**Step 2.** Wire `analyticOfCurve_injective`:
```lean
lemma analyticOfCurve_injective (P : X) (h : 0 < analyticGenus ℂ X) :
    Function.Injective (analyticOfCurve X P) := by
  intro Q₁ Q₂ heq
  apply pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points X P h Q₁ Q₂
  exact QuotientAddGroup.eq.mp heq
```
This collapses the top-down obligation to the named bottom-up
obligation `pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points`.

**Step 3 (future bottom-up).** Discharge
`pathIntegralFunctional_separates_points` via one of:
- A formalised Riemann-Roch argument (requires extensive new Mathlib
  infrastructure: meromorphic functions on manifolds, divisors, degree
  theory, genus-0 classification);
- A direct 1-form separation argument (requires integration theory on
  manifolds, homotopy invariance of integrals, and the classical
  result that holomorphic 1-forms separate points modulo periods on
  compact Riemann surfaces of positive genus);
- `MDifferentiable.exists_eq_const_of_compactSpace` as the key
  Mathlib ingredient: if a degree-1 meromorphic function existed, it
  would give a non-constant holomorphic function on a compact
  connected manifold, contradicting this lemma. But bridging from
  "period-congruent integrals" to "existence of degree-1 meromorphic
  function" still requires divisor theory not in Mathlib.
