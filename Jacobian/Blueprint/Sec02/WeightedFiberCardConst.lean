/-! # Blueprint: well-definedness of the branched degree (4-step decomposition)

Section 2 of `tex/sections/02-holomorphic-forms-and-genus.tex`.

This file decomposes the proof of `weightedFiberCard_const` (the
remaining `sorry` in `Sec02/BranchedDegreeFromHolomorphic.lean`) into
four sub-leaves, each stated as a `sorry`-bearing theorem.  Together
they give the well-definedness of the branched degree:

  1. **Branch locus finite** (`mapAnalyticOrderAt_ramified_finite`):
     for a nonconstant holomorphic map between compact preconnected
     complex 1-manifolds, the source-side ramified set
     `{x | mapAnalyticOrderAt f x ≠ 1}` is finite.  Standard proof:
     in each chart, `e_x(f) ≥ 2` is equivalent to vanishing of the
     chart-pulled derivative `(ψ ∘ f ∘ φ⁻¹)'(φ x)`; the derivative is
     itself analytic, so its zero set is discrete by the analytic
     identity principle (`AnalyticAt.eventually_ne` in Mathlib).
     Discrete-in-each-chart + compactness ⇒ finite.

  2. **Local injectivity at unramified points**
     (`IsHolomorphicAt.exists_local_inj_of_unramified`): if
     `mapAnalyticOrderAt f x = 1`, there's an open neighborhood `U`
     of `x` and an open neighborhood `V` of `f x` such that for every
     `y ∈ V`, the set `U ∩ f⁻¹ {y}` is a singleton.  Standard proof:
     order-1 ⇒ chart-local derivative nonzero at chart `x`; Mathlib's
     `AnalyticAt.localInverse` / inverse-function theorem on `ℂ` ⇒
     local biholomorphism; transport back through charts.

  3. **Local k-fold structure at ramified points**
     (`IsHolomorphicAt.exists_local_kfold_of_ramified`): if
     `mapAnalyticOrderAt f x = k` with `k ≥ 1`, there's a neighborhood
     `U` of `x` and a neighborhood `V` of `f x` such that for every
     `y ∈ V` with `y ≠ f x`, the set `U ∩ f⁻¹ {y}` consists of exactly
     `k` distinct unramified preimages.  Standard proof: in suitable
     local chart-coordinates, `f` looks like `t ↦ t^k` near `0`
     (Mathlib's `AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_eq_natCast` gives the
     local power-series form `f(t) = t^k · g(t)` with `g(0) ≠ 0`,
     then a holomorphic local change-of-variables flattens `g` to a
     constant).  The map `t ↦ t^k` has exactly `k` simple preimages
     of any nonzero target.

  4. **Local conservation of weighted fibre count**
     (`isHolomorphic_weightedFiberSum_isLocallyConstant`): combining
     leaves 2 and 3, the weighted fibre sum `∑_{x ∈ f⁻¹{y}} e_x(f)`
     is locally constant on `Y`.  Proof: at each `y₀ : Y`, the fibre
     `f⁻¹{y₀}` is finite (by `isHolomorphic_finite_fiber`); choose
     disjoint open neighborhoods of each preimage; each unramified
     preimage contributes `1` to the local count for `y` near `y₀`
     (leaf 2); each ramified preimage of order `k` contributes `k`
     simple preimages (leaf 3) summing to `k` again.  The total
     weighted count at `y` equals the total weighted count at `y₀`.

The final theorem `isHolomorphic_weightedFiberSum_const` follows
from leaf 4 plus `IsLocallyConstant.apply_eq_of_preconnectedSpace`,
and is exactly the field needed to discharge the remaining `sorry`
in `branchedCoverData_of_nonconstant_holomorphic`. -/

The next two helpers are used by both sub-leaf A (branch locus
finite) and sub-leaf B (local injectivity at unramified). -/

**Common helper (sorry).** Order = 1 at `x` is equivalent to
the chart-local derivative being nonzero at `chartAt ℂ x x`.

This is a direct re-packaging of Mathlib's
`AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_sub_eq_one_of_deriv_ne_zero` plus the
characterisation `analyticOrderNatAt = 1 ↔ analyticOrderAt = 1` on
finite-order analytic functions.

/-! ### Sub-leaf A: branch locus finite

The decomposition is:

  * A1 = the common helper above (`= 1 ↔ deriv ≠ 0`),
  * A2 `isOpen_setOf_mapAnalyticOrderAt_eq_one` — unramified set is
    open in `X`,
  * A3 `mapAnalyticOrderAt_isolated_at_ramified` — every ramified
    point is isolated in the ramified set,
  * A4 `mapAnalyticOrderAt_ramified_finite` — assembly: closed
    discrete subset of compact ⇒ finite. -/

/-
**A2 (sorry).** The unramified set
`{x : X | mapAnalyticOrderAt f x = 1}` is open in `X`.

Proof sketch: order = 1 at `x` ⇔ chart-local derivative nonzero at
`chartAt ℂ x x` (common helper).  The chart-local derivative is itself
analytic, hence continuous; the set where a continuous function is
nonzero is open in `ℂ`; pull back through the chart to get openness
in `X`.

/-- **A3 (sorry).** Every ramified point is isolated in the ramified
set: at a point `x` with order ≠ 1, there's a neighborhood `U` of `x`
such that every other point in `U` is unramified.

Proof sketch: if `mapAnalyticOrderAt f x = k ≥ 2`, the chart-local
derivative `(chartLocalAt f x)' (z)` vanishes at `z = chartAt ℂ x x`
to order `k - 1 ≥ 1` (subtracting `1` because differentiating drops
the order by one).  Apply Mathlib's `AnalyticAt.eventually_ne` to the
chart-local derivative to obtain a punctured neighborhood of
`chartAt ℂ x x` where the derivative is nonzero, then transport back
through the chart and apply the common helper to identify those
points as having order = 1. -/

  * From A2, the ramified set is closed in `X` (complement of an open
    set).  Closed in compact ⇒ compact subspace.
  * From A3, every ramified point is isolated in the ramified set, so
    the subspace topology on the ramified set is discrete.

Decomposition:

  * B1 = the common helper above (`= 1 ↔ deriv ≠ 0`),
  * B2 `chartLocalAt_localInverse_of_unramified` — at a chart-locally
    unramified point, the chart-local function admits a holomorphic
    local inverse (Mathlib's `AnalyticAt.localInverse`),
  * B3 `IsHolomorphicAt.exists_local_inj_of_unramified` — assembly:
    transport the chart-local inverse to a manifold-level injective
    neighborhood. -/

/-- **B2 (sorry).** At an unramified point `x`, the chart-local
function `chartLocalAt f x` has a holomorphic local inverse.

Proof sketch: from B1 the chart-local derivative is nonzero at
`chartAt ℂ x x`.  Mathlib's analytic inverse function theorem
`AnalyticAt.localInverse` (in `Analysis/Analytic/Inverse.lean`)
produces an analytic local inverse.  Wrap as the existence of an
analytic `g : ℂ → ℂ` with mutual local-inverse equations. -/

    `chartLocalAt(t) - chart(f x) = (t - z₀)^k · g(t)` with
    `g(z₀) ≠ 0`, from Mathlib's `AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_eq_natCast`,
  * C2 `analyticAt_kth_root_of_ne_zero` — analytic `k`-th root of a
    locally nonvanishing analytic function (via complex log + cpow,
    or Mathlib's `Complex.cpow` machinery),

    `s = (t - z₀) · g(t)^{1/k}` flattens the local form to `s ↦ s^k`,

    manifold side. -/

the centred chart-local function factors as `(t - z₀)^k · g(t)` for
some analytic `g` with `g(z₀) ≠ 0`, where `z₀ = chartAt ℂ x x`.

Proof sketch: this is Mathlib's
`AnalyticAt.analyticOrderAt_eq_natCast` applied to the centred
chart-local difference `t ↦ chartLocalAt f x t - chartLocalAt f x z₀`
at `z₀`, with `n = k`.  Mathlib gives existence of analytic `g` with

`(t - z₀)^k • g(t)` near `z₀`. -/

choose a continuous (in fact analytic) branch of `log g` (using
`Complex.log` on a simply-connected nbhd of `g(z₀)` avoiding `0`).
Define `h := exp ((1/k) * log g)`.  Then `h^k = exp(log g) = g`.

/-- **D2 (sorry).** Properness on a compact source: for any open `U`
containing the fibre `f⁻¹ {y₀}`, there is a neighborhood `V` of `y₀`
such that for every `y ∈ V`, `f⁻¹ {y} ⊆ U`.

Proof sketch: `Uᶜ` is closed, hence compact (closed subset of compact
`X`).  Its image `f(Uᶜ)` is compact, hence closed (in `T2Space Y`),
and does not contain `y₀` (since `f⁻¹ {y₀} ⊆ U` ⇒ `Uᶜ ⊆ f⁻¹ {y₀}ᶜ`).
So `f(Uᶜ)ᶜ` is an open neighborhood of `y₀`; on it,
`y ∉ f(Uᶜ) ⇔ f⁻¹ {y} ∩ Uᶜ = ∅ ⇔ f⁻¹ {y} ⊆ U`. -/

/-- **D3 (sorry).** Local conservation at a single base point.
Combining D1, D2, sub-leaf B (at unramified preimages) and sub-leaf C
(at ramified preimages), the weighted fibre sum is constant on a
neighborhood of `y₀`.

Proof sketch: pick disjoint open `U_x ∋ x` for each `x ∈ f⁻¹ {y₀}`
(D1); shrink each `U_x` so sub-leaf B (if order = 1) or sub-leaf C
(if order ≥ 2) applies, with associated neighborhoods `V_x` of `y₀`
in `Y`.  Take `V := ⋂ V_x ∩ V'` where `V'` is the neighborhood from
D2 ensuring `f⁻¹ {y} ⊆ ⋃ U_x` for `y ∈ V'`.  On `V`:

  * `f⁻¹ {y}` decomposes as the disjoint union of `U_x ∩ f⁻¹ {y}`
    over `x ∈ f⁻¹ {y₀}`;
  * each `U_x ∩ f⁻¹ {y}` contributes exactly `mapAnalyticOrderAt f x`
    to the weighted sum (`1` for unramified by B, `k` for ramified
    of order `k` by C, regardless of whether `y = y₀` or not — see
    proof of leaf 7 in `BranchedDegree.lean` for the same kind of
    sum-via-Finset.sum bookkeeping).

So `weightedFiberSum y = ∑_{x ∈ f⁻¹ {y₀}} mapAnalyticOrderAt f x =
weightedFiberSum y₀` on `V`. -/
