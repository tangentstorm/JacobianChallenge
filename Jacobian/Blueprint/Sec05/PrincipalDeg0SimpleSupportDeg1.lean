/-! # Blueprint stub: `lem:principal-deg0-simple-support-deg1`

Section 5 of `tex/sections/05-abel-jacobi-map.tex`.

If `f ∈ Mer(X)^{×}` has principal divisor `(f) = Q₁ - Q₂` with
`Q₁ ≠ Q₂`, then the associated map `f̂ : X → ℂP¹` is nonconstant of
degree 1.

## Status

**Real type signature.** The conclusion is stated with the genuine
`Nonconstant` / `branchedDegree` predicates; the proof is `sorry`
because the upstream analytic infrastructure (open-mapping theorem,
`BranchedCoverData` constructor for meromorphic maps) is still
frontier-bound.

The Worker AE branch (claude/abel-deeper-k7vp2x) provides supporting
combinatorial infrastructure under a nested
`AbelExistence.PrincipalDeg0SimpleSupportDeg1` namespace: the
two-point-divisor model and the deg-0/two-point-support arithmetic.
That infrastructure is preserved here so the eventual real proof can
plug in immediately.

`BranchedCoverData.branchedDegree`; that analytic constructor is
still frontier-bound, so we leave the body as `0` (an obviously

/-! ### TOPDOWN decomposition (round 1)

The headline theorem is split into 4 named sub-obligations + a sorry-free
assembly. Each sub-obligation is individually attackable; the deepest
(`branchedDegree_eq_one_of_singleton_pole_set`) bottoms out in the
frontier `BranchedCoverData` constructor, which is the genuine analytic
gap. The other three are mostly classical bookkeeping. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf 1.** If `(f) = [Q₁] - [Q₂]` with `Q₁ ≠ Q₂`, then `f`
takes the pole value `∞` at `Q₂`: i.e. `meromorphicToCp1 X f Q₂ = ∞`.

Bottom-up content: the principal-divisor description records the
Laurent order at every point. Coefficient `-1` at `Q₂` means a simple
pole, hence `f.toFun Q₂ = ∞`. Should follow from the
`principalDivisor`-`vanishingOrder` adjunction in
`Sec01/PrincipalDivisor.lean` plus the fact that
`MeromorphicFunctionType` records poles by sending them to `∞`. -/

pole) we get `branchedDegreeOfMap = 1`. This is the deep frontier sub-
obligation: it requires the `BranchedCoverData` constructor for
nonconstant holomorphic maps to ℂP¹, plus the constancy-of-weighted-

Assembled from the four sub-leaves above:
- nonconstancy: sub-leaves 1+2 give distinct values at `Q₁` and `Q₂`,
  then sub-leaf 3 gives nonconstancy.
- branched-degree-1: sub-leaf 4 directly. -/
