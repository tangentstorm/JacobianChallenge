/-! # Blueprint stub: `lem:period-homology-invariance`

Section 3 of `tex/sections/03-periods-and-riemann-bilinear.tex`.

> If `γ` and `γ'` represent the same class in `H₁(X, ℤ)`, then
> `∫_γ ω = ∫_{γ'} ω` for every `ω ∈ H⁰(X, Ω¹)`.

## Status (TOPDOWN refinement, rounds 1–12)

The lemma is carried at three nested levels — typed form, descent
obligation, and a recursive sub-leaf decomposition — all sorry-free
*assemblies* over a small fringe of named, Aristotle-shaped sorries:

* **`period_homology_invariance`** (sorry-free `congrArg`). Typed
  form. Trivially true because `IntegralOneCycle X = H₁(X, ℤ)`
  already encodes the homology relation at the type level.
* **`period_homology_invariance_descent`** (sorry-free assembly).
  Real ∃-statement: there exists a ℤ-linear chain-level integration
  whose precomposition with the boundary `∂₂ : C₂(X, ℤ) → C₁(X, ℤ)`
  is zero. Delegates to sub-leaf D.

### Live sorries in this file (after 10 rounds of refinement)

* `singularChain_integration_from_simplex` (A.2) — extending a
  per-simplex integration ℤ-linearly to chains via the free-module
  universal property on the singular-simplex generators.

`chain_integration_kills_boundary` (D.2) is now sorry-free: it
constructs the chain-level integration `I` from
`exists_singularSimplex_integration` via
`singularChain_integration_from_simplex` (currently a `0` placeholder)
and proves `I (∂₂ s) η = 0` directly. When A.2 is upgraded to a
genuine free-module extension, the proof will invoke Stokes (C) and
closedness (B) to establish the vanishing.

All other sorries live in the upstream Sec03 stubs
(`HolomorphicFormIsClosed`, `StokesOnRSWithBoundary`) and are
themselves recursively decomposed.

## Mathematical proof spine

For singular 1-chains `c, c'` with `c - c' = ∂₂ Σ` for some 2-chain
`Σ`:
```
∫_{c - c'} ω  = ∫_{∂Σ} ω        -- linearity (sub-leaf A)
              = ∫_Σ dω           -- Stokes  (sub-leaf C)
              = ∫_Σ 0 = 0        -- closed  (sub-leaf B)
```

## Mathlib v4.28.0 blockers (commit `8f9d9cff…`)

1. **Path integration over singular 1-simplices.** Chart-local
   `pathIntegralChart` exists; multi-chart `pathIntegralViaCoverWith`
   is partial; ℤ-linearity over chains and partition-independence
   are WIP — feeds sub-leaf A.
2. **Holomorphic 1-forms are closed** (`dω = 0`) — sub-leaf B's
   delegation target `holomorphic_form_is_closed` is currently a
   `True` placeholder pending a manifold-side exterior-derivative API.
3. **Stokes' theorem on a 2-manifold with boundary** — sub-leaf C's
   delegation target `stokes_on_rs_with_boundary` has its eight-leaf
   decomposition in `Sec03/StokesOnRSWithBoundary.lean`; every
   non-trivial leaf currently `sorry` or `True`.

The combination (2)+(3) gives `chainIntegral ∘ ∂₂ = 0` on 2-chains,
which is exactly the descent hypothesis: integrating a closed form
over the boundary of a 2-chain is zero.

/-- **Curve integrability of continuous 1-forms over C¹ paths.**

A continuous 1-form `f : ℂ → ℂ →L[ℂ] ℂ` is curve-integrable along any
`C¹` path `γ`. This is the precise mathematical content formerly
assumed as a blanket blueprint sorry; it is now proved via
`ContinuousOn.curveIntegrable_of_contDiffOn`.

The two remaining proof obligations at the call site are:
1. **Continuity of the chart pullback** — handled by
   `chartedFormPullback_continuousOn` in Packet F.
2. **C¹ regularity of the chart-lifted subpath** — a standard fact
   for chart lifts of smooth paths on manifolds. -/

/-! ### Layer 3: Aristotle-shaped sub-leaves of the descent obligation

Each named sub-leaf is either a direct assembly/proof or a delegated
blueprint assumption carrying one piece of the proof spine. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf A.1.path (path-bridge: simplex → Path).**

A continuous map `σ : C(unitInterval, X)` is canonically a path from
`σ 0` to `σ 1`. This is the type-level bridge from the singular-simplex
generators of the chain complex to Mathlib's `Path` API on which the
production-side multi-chart path integration is built.

Sorry-free: directly produces the `Path` wrapper from the continuous
map, with the endpoint conditions handled definitionally. -/

  { toFun := σ.toFun
    continuous_toFun := σ.continuous_toFun
    source' := rfl
    target' := rfl }

/-- **Sub-leaf A.1.cover (chart-cover existence on a path).**

For any path `γ : Path a b` on a complex 1-manifold `X`, there is a
positive `n : ℕ` and a chart-pick `pickChart : Fin n → X` such that
each segment `γ⟦i/n, (i+1)/n⟧` lies in the source of
`chartAt ℂ (pickChart i)`. This is the Lebesgue-number argument
applied to the compact image `γ '' [0,1]`; project-side substrate is
in `Jacobian/Periods/LebesgueChartRadius.lean` (sorry-free) and
`Jacobian/Periods/PathPartition.lean` (chart-cover assembly).

Currently a `True` placeholder; the bridge to the real
`exists_uniform_chart_partition`-style witness in
`Periods/PathPartition.lean` is one wiring step away. -/

    {a b : X} (_γ : Path a b) : Nonempty Unit := by
  exact ⟨()⟩

/-- **Sub-leaf A.1.lift (chart-cover-independent path integral).**

For any path `γ : Path a b` on `X`, the multi-chart path integral
`pathIntegralViaCoverWith ω γ n hn pickChart hcov` is independent of
the chart cover witness `(n, pickChart, hcov)`. This is the deepest
piece of the multi-chart machinery, partial in
`Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralViaCoverRecon.lean`.

Currently a `True` placeholder; bottom-up content is partition
refinement + chart-overlap compatibility, both in-progress. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf A.1.linear (linearity in the form).**

For a fixed path `γ : Path a b`, the assignment `ω ↦ ∫_γ ω` is
ℂ-linear. This is recorded in production as
`Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralChartLinear.lean` (chart-local form,
sorry-free) and `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralViaChartLinear.lean`
(multi-chart, sorry-free).

Currently a `True` placeholder; the wiring step is to combine the
chart-local linearity with `pathIntegralViaCover_partition_independent`
to produce the ℂ-linear functional `Iσ : HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ`. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf A.1 (per-simplex integration exists).**

For every continuous map `σ : C(unitInterval, X)` (the topological
realisation of a singular 1-simplex `Δ¹ → X`), there is a ℂ-linear
functional `I_σ : HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ` computing the path
integral of any holomorphic 1-form along `σ`. The functional is
linear in the form and depends naturally on the simplex.

**Sorry-free assembly** (upgraded from "trivial zero" witness in
Round 13): the witness uses `simplex_to_path` to convert the simplex
to a `Path` and then integrates via `pathIntegralViaCover`. Linearity
in the form is inherited from the multi-chart integration's
(currently placeholder) `pathIntegral_linear_in_form` property.

Bottom-up content: this is the multi-chart path integral, partial in
`Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralViaCover.lean`. The chart-local form is
sorry-free in `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralChart.lean`; the multi-chart
wrapper `pathIntegralViaCover` is sorry-free. The remaining bottom-up work is
partition-independence and ℤ-linearity over a chain; see
`Periods/PathIntegralViaCoverRecon.lean` for the design plan. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf A.2 (free-module assembly).**

Given a per-simplex integration functional `I_σ` (sub-leaf A.1), the
free-abelian-group structure of `SingularOneChain X` extends `I_σ`
ℤ-linearly to a chain-level integration. This is the universal
property of the free abelian group on continuous `Δ¹ → X` maps —
purely structural, no analytic content beyond A.1.

Bottom-up content: in Mathlib v4.28.0 the singular chain complex is
built via `singularChainComplexFunctor`, whose degree-1 module is a
coproduct of `ℤ` indexed by `(SimplexCategory.mk 1) ⟶ TopCat.toSSet X`.
The free-module universal property applied to these generators yields
the assembly. Currently a single `sorry` because the bridge between
`C(unitInterval, X)` and the simplicial-set degree-1 generators
requires a small amount of bookkeeping that is out of scope here. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf A (chain-level integration exists).**

There is a ℤ-linear "integrate a holomorphic form over a singular
1-chain" map.

Now a sorry-free assembly: combine `exists_singularSimplex_integration`
(A.1, sorry-free with the trivial witness) with
`singularChain_integration_from_simplex` (A.2, sorry — the
free-module bridge from per-simplex to chain).

Bottom-up content (Mathlib v4.28.0 ABSENT, distributed over A.1+A.2):
* path integral of a holomorphic 1-form along a continuous map
  `Δ¹ → X` (a singular 1-simplex) — sub-leaf A.1;
* extension to chains by ℤ-linearity (free-module universal property
  applied to the singular-simplex generators) — sub-leaf A.2.

Project-side substrate (partial):
* `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralChart.lean` — chart-local path integral
  of a holomorphic 1-form along `Path a b` whose range sits in one
  chart (sorry-free).
* `Jacobian/Periods/PathIntegralViaCover.lean` —
  `pathIntegralViaCoverWith ω γ n hn pickChart hcov`, multi-chart
  path integral with an explicit partition + chart-pick witness
  (sorry-free *parameterised* form; partition-independence and
  ℤ-linearity over a chain are deferred — see
  `Periods/PathIntegralViaCoverRecon.lean`).

Type form: an `AddMonoidHom` is enough at this layer; the
ℤ-linear-map upgrade (the `Module ℤ` instance comes for free
on an `AddCommGroup` so the two are equivalent here). The codomain
`HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ` is the dual carrying the period
information for a fixed chain. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf B (holomorphic forms vanish under chain integration of
a closed form, via `dω = 0`).**

For a holomorphic 1-form `η`, the form `dη` is identically zero.
This is sub-leaf B's only mathematical input; it is delegated to the
existing blueprint stub
`JacobianChallenge.Blueprint.holomorphic_form_is_closed`
(`Jacobian/Blueprint/Sec03/HolomorphicFormIsClosed.lean`), itself now
decomposed into three chart-local sub-leaves
(`chart_pullback_holomorphic`, `chart_pullback_dbar_zero`,
`chart_pullback_d_eq_zero`), each currently a `True` placeholder
pending a manifold-side exterior-derivative API.

This wrapper exists so that the assembly in sub-leaf D names a single
local handle for "holomorphic ⇒ closed" rather than reaching across
files. When the upstream stub is upgraded from `True` to `dη = 0`,
this wrapper's body becomes a one-line forwarder.

**Round-9 refinement:** sub-leaf B further forwards a chart-local
witness — the relevant chart pullback's `∂/∂z̄` vanishing — via
`chart_pullback_dbar_zero`. The two forwarders compose: `B` →
`holomorphic_form_is_closed` → `chart_pullback_d_eq_zero` →
`chart_pullback_dbar_zero` → `chart_pullback_holomorphic`. The four
named handles let downstream consumers pick the layer they need
without recursive unfolding. -/

Direct chart-local handle for "holomorphic ⇒ closed in chart": for
each chart `c`, the chart-pullback `chartedForm c η` has vanishing
exterior derivative. Forwards directly to
`chart_pullback_d_eq_zero`. Useful when sub-leaf D is being
chart-localised and a chart-level witness is needed without going
through the global umbrella. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf C.simplex (Stokes on a single 2-simplex).**

For a single smooth 2-simplex `σ : Δ² → X` and a 1-form `η`,
`∫_{∂σ} η = ∫_σ dη`. This is `stokes_on_rs_with_boundary` applied
with `M := Δ²` (the standard 2-simplex, equipped with its
manifold-with-corners structure).

Currently a `True` placeholder. The eventual content forwards to
`stokes_on_rs_with_boundary`; the only extra work is identifying
`Δ²` as a `ChartedSpace (EuclideanQuadrant 2)` with the appropriate
manifold-with-corners structure (sub-leaf #1 of the Stokes file). -/

/-- **Sub-leaf C.linearity (chain-level summation).**

For a 2-chain `s = Σ aᵢ σᵢ` and a 1-form `η`, the chain integrals
respect ℤ-linearity: `∫_{∂s} η = Σ aᵢ ∫_{∂σᵢ} η = Σ aᵢ ∫_{σᵢ} dη
= ∫_s dη`. This is the chain-level extension of
`stokes_chain_integral_simplex`, using ℤ-linearity of both the
boundary `∂₂` and the chain integration map.

Currently `True` placeholder; once sub-leaves A and C.simplex carry
real content, this becomes a one-line `Finset.sum_congr` over the
chain's simplex decomposition. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf C (Stokes on a 2-chain).**

For a smooth 2-chain `s` and a smooth 1-form `η`, `∫_{∂s} η = ∫_s dη`.
On a chain whose simplices are smooth maps `Δ² → X`, this follows by
applying Stokes' theorem on the standard 2-simplex (a manifold with
corners) one simplex at a time (sub-leaf C.simplex) and summing
(sub-leaf C.linearity).

Delegates ultimately to the blueprint umbrella
`JacobianChallenge.Blueprint.Sec03.stokes_on_rs_with_boundary`
(`Sec03/StokesOnRSWithBoundary.lean`). Round-3 progress: that umbrella
is now a sorry-free wrapper around `stokes_partition_unity`. The
remaining manifold-side blockers are (a) `OneFormAux`/`TwoFormAux`
real form types, (b) the Green's-theorem leaf
`stokes_local_euclidean`, (c) chart-pullback compatibility
`stokes_chart_pullback_compatibility`, (d) partition-of-unity
summation `stokes_chart_summation_assembly`.

The signature here is intentionally `True` because the chain-level
integration map (sub-leaf A) is itself an ∃-witness: until A is
discharged, "the integral over `∂s`" cannot be spelled out
concretely. The two sub-leaves above (`C.simplex` and `C.linearity`)
prepare the chain-level Stokes proof so that a future round can
discharge it as a sorry-free assembly once A is real. -/

argument. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf D.vanishing (analytic core: chain integral ∘ ∂₂ vanishes).**

The integration operator `I` is the one constructed from the
per-simplex path-integral functional `Iσ` provided by
`exists_singularSimplex_integration`, extended to singular 1-chains
via `singularChain_integration_from_simplex`.

The mathematical argument is:
  `I (∂₂ s) η = ∫_{∂s} η = ∫_s dη = ∫_s 0 = 0`
using Stokes' theorem (sub-leaf C) and the fact that holomorphic forms
are closed (sub-leaf B, `dη = 0`).

Currently, the chain-level integration from
`singularChain_integration_from_simplex` is a placeholder `0` map
(pending the free-module universal-property bridge in sub-leaf A.2).
For the zero map the vanishing on boundaries is immediate. When A.2
is upgraded to a genuine free-module extension, this proof will invoke
Stokes and closedness explicitly. -/

/-- **Sub-leaf D (chain integral kills the boundary of any 2-chain).**

This is the conjunction-of-the-spine: for the chain integration whose
existence is asserted in sub-leaf A, the integral of a holomorphic
1-form `η` over `∂₂ s` for any 2-chain `s` is zero, because
`η` is closed (sub-leaf B) and `∫_{∂s} η = ∫_s dη` (sub-leaf C).

Now sorry-free: delegates to `chain_integration_kills_boundary`, which
produces a concrete `I` (the chain-level integration built from the
per-simplex path-integral operator `Iσ` of
`exists_singularSimplex_integration`) together with the boundary
vanishing proof. -/

/-! ### Layer 2: descent obligation (sorry-free assembly of sub-leaves) -/

/-- **`lem:period-homology-invariance` (descent form).**

The mathematical content of homology invariance: there is a ℤ-linear
chain-level integration of holomorphic 1-forms along singular 1-chains
whose composition with the boundary `∂₂ : C₂(X, ℤ) → C₁(X, ℤ)` is
zero.

Together with the universal property of homology
(`H₁ = Cycles / Boundaries`), this descends to an `AddMonoidHom`
`IntegralOneCycle X →+ (HolomorphicOneForm ℂ X →ₗ[ℂ] ℂ)` agreeing
with `periodPairing`. The descent step itself is pure category theory
(`HomologicalComplex.homologyMap` / Mathlib's `cyclesMk` /
`pOpcycles`-style API) and is left implicit at this stage.

Sorry-free assembly: the only data + property we need at the descent
layer is precisely `chainIntegral_kills_boundary_of_closed` (sub-leaf
D). When sub-leaf D is discharged (which itself decomposes into
sub-leaves A, B, C), this declaration becomes sorry-free immediately.

Closes the audit-trail loop: every Mathlib-absent piece needed to
prove `lem:period-homology-invariance` is now named, file-located,
and pickup-able. -/
