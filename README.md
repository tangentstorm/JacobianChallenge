# Jacobian Challenge

A Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization project targeting the Jacobian variety of a
compact Riemann surface.

The public specification lives in `Jacobian/Challenge.lean` and asks for:

- `genus X` for a compact Riemann surface `X`;
- `Jacobian X` as a compact complex Lie additive group of dimension `genus X`;
- the Abel-Jacobi map `Jacobian.ofCurve`;
- pushforward and pullback maps along holomorphic maps;
- the degree of a holomorphic map of compact Riemann surfaces;
- the identity `pushforward f (pullback f P) = degree f • P`.

Approach: the analytic period-lattice construction
`Jacobian X = H0(X, Ω¹)* / H1(X, Z)`, built up through reusable layers
(complex tori, holomorphic forms, period integration, Abel-Jacobi, degree).

See `plan.md` for the full roadmap, phase breakdown, anti-hack audit, and
delegation strategy for Aristotle.

Aristotle status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Active jobs (ours): 0/5. Aristotle queue still wedged server-wide
                    (5 unrelated jobs QUEUED 5h+ with no progress).
                    No new submissions this tick — piling onto a
                    wedge is wasteful, and there's plenty of safe
                    local work.
Integrated this tick: nothing from Aristotle (queue stuck).
Local progress this tick: added `ComplexTorus/Witness.lean`
                          discharging `quotientChartedSpaceStatement`
                          and `quotientIsManifoldStatement` from
                          the StatementBank using the concrete
                          `complexTorusChartedSpace` instance. Both
                          witnesses are one-liners; the file builds
                          green.
Quotient manifold layer: 100%. ChartedSpace + IsManifold both done,
                         no sorries. StatementBank Queue B placeholder
                         targets that the chart layer was supposed
                         to discharge are now witnessed.

Next tick priorities
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. Lie-add-group structure on the quotient (smooth `+` and `-`).
   Both descend from the linear ambient operations through the
   chart machinery. Needed for `Jacobian X` to satisfy the public
   `LieAddGroup` requirement.
2. Begin Queue C: `HolomorphicOneForm`. First packet: define
   the type and prove the `AddCommGroup` / `Module ℂ` structure
   using existing differential-form API.
3. Stretch goal: state finite-dimensionality of holomorphic
   1-forms as a named theorem, even if the proof is deferred.
