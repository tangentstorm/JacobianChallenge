# Jacobian Challenge

A Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization project targeting the Jacobian variety of a
compact Riemann surface.

The public specification lives in `Jacobian/Challenge.lean` and asks for:

- `genus X` for a compact Riemann surface `X`;
- `Jacobian X` as a compact complex Lie additive group of dimension `genus X`;
- the Abel-Jacobi map `Jacobian.ofCurve`;
- pushforward and pullback maps along holomorphic maps;
- the degree of a holomorphic map of compact Riemann surfaces;
- the identity `pushforward f (pullback f P) = degree f • P`.

Approach: the analytic period-lattice construction
`Jacobian X = H0(X, Ω¹)* / H1(X, Z)`, built up through reusable layers
(complex tori, holomorphic forms, period integration, Abel-Jacobi, degree).
